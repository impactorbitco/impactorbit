  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Using AI in Your Application</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome applications that use AI tools for support in drafting or refining content, as long as all material accurately reflects your own skills and experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    All hiring decisions are made by people, not AI. Using AI should only support the clarity of your application and not replace your own insights or examples. For more details, see our <a href="/recruitment/ai-guidance" class="underline text-accent-600 dark:text-accent-300">approach to recruitment</a>.
