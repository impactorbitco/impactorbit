    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="space-y-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <p>
        At Green Orbit Digital, we are deeply committed to supporting charities and not-for-profits that align with our values of sustainability and positive change. Through our pro-bono services, we aim to contribute meaningfully to the missions of these organisations, helping them amplify their impact while ensuring that our expertise serves the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our pro-bono strategy focuses on partnerships that drive progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly <strong>SDG 17 – Partnership for the Goals</strong>. By working closely with charities and civil society organisations, we ensure that our contributions are both sustainable and impactful, offering tailored support that aligns with the unique needs of each charity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We carefully select our pro-bono projects, engaging in transparent discussions with organisations to define the scope, capacity, and expectations from the outset. This collaborative approach ensures that we deliver effective, results-driven support, empowering our charity partners to further their missions and create lasting, positive change.
