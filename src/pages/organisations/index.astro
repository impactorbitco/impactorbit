        Green Orbit Digital actively collaborates with a diverse network of organisations to advance sustainability and innovation across the space sector. Our partnerships span industry, research, and advocacy, helping amplify the impact of space-based solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We engage with <strong>UK-EONS</strong> to work alongside leading Earth observation organisations, and the <strong>Space Enterprise Community</strong>, connecting with key UK space industry players. As members of <strong>UKspace</strong> and <em>Space for Climate</em>, we advocate for space-enabled climate solutions that deliver tangible environmental benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the European stage, we contribute to the <strong>European Association of Remote Sensing Companies (EARSC)</strong>, promoting the use of satellite data for sustainability. We also support the <strong>IAU Committee on the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky</strong>, ensuring responsible satellite operations to protect night skies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, through the <strong>BSI Sustainable Space Community</strong>, we help define standards for environmentally responsible space practices. Together, these collaborations allow Green Orbit Digital to foster a sustainable and innovative space ecosystem.
