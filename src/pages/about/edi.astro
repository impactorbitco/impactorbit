    <p>
      At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise that diverse perspectives drive stronger ideas, 
      more innovative solutions, and a more resilient organisation. By creating an environment 
      where everyone belongs, we empower our team to do their best work and ensure our impact 
      benefits the communities and industries we serve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is grounded in openness, 
      transparency, and continuous improvement. We aim to build a team that reflects the 
      diversity of the UK and the global space, technology and sustainability communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      EDI is not a box-ticking exercise—it is a fundamental part of who we are and how we work.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Our Inclusive Culture</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
      Our workplace is shaped by openness, collaboration, and the belief that all voices 
      should be heard. We maintain this through regular company-wide updates, open feedback 
      channels, and internal communities that help shape our direction.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
      We support a range of employee-led affinity groups—including networks for parents, 
      women in tech, mental health awareness, and early-career professionals. These groups 
      champion initiatives and ensure our EDI culture is lived, not just stated.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
      Our year-round EDI and wellbeing programme includes celebrations and learning 
      opportunities around events such as International Women’s Day, Pride, National 
      Inclusion Week, and Black History Month. Through workshops, talks, and shared 
      learning, we strengthen awareness across the organisation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
      We also believe in connection and community—through social events, volunteering, 
      sports groups, film clubs, and shared interests that bring our team together.
