This talk dives into the real-world challenges of tackling cloud emissions, starting with the incomplete, often inaccurate, and rarely actionable data provided by the cloud providers.\r\n\r\nWe'll explore the current landscape of commercial solutions, share how we partnered with one based in our region to help a leading Bristol-based organisation cut their cloud emissions, and discuss how these tools compare in practice.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we'll introduce key concepts, offer practical tips, and dig into some of the toughest hurdles—from navigating imperfect data to convincing internal stakeholders, all grounded in my own experience as a developer. We'll also touch on a topic that everybody is expecting: how to estimate the carbon impact of AI workloads and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).\r\n\r\nFinally, we’ll explore the growing ecosystem of open source tools, and how they can empower individuals across an organisation to take initiative, influence decision-making, and foster a culture of sustainability.",

Zwozny-Bestwick. I’m a non-traditional, eco-friendly Silversmith & Sculptor, working from my CRZyBest Shedquarters in Derby, creating tiny sculptures in metal clay and turning them into jewellery and accessories. Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

    "title": "Legal ESG: Europe",
    "description": "ESG is moving from voluntary ambition to mandated action.\nAs Europe rolls out sweeping new regulations – from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D) – businesses face unprecedented obligations to report on sustainability and police their supply chains. At the same time, regulators around the world are ramping up ESG enforcement, and courts are seeing a surge in climate and ESG-related lawsuits.\nThe question is no longer if companies and their legal advisors should prioritize ESG, but how to do so effectively, in full compliance, and in ways that stand up to scrutiny.\nLegal ESG: Europe 2025, taking place on 16th October 2025 at Baker McKenzie’s Paris office, is an opportunity for law firm leaders, in-house counsel, compliance professionals, and ESG experts to come together, learn from each other, and drive the ESG agenda forward. It’s a chance to reflect on the progress made so far, confront the challenges on the horizon, and commit to a future where ESG is a fundamental element of corporate strategy and legal practice. Join us to exchange ideas, prepare for what’s next, and ensure that your organization is ready for this new chapter of ESG.\nDiscussions Will Include\nHow will new EU directives like CSRD and CS3D reshape corporate accountability and legal risk?\nAre companies prepared to meet stringent ESG reporting requirements and conduct due diligence across global supply chains?\nWhat do rising climate lawsuits and greenwashing crackdowns mean for businesses and their counsel?\nHow are regulators and investors globally enforcing ESG commitments and holding organizations accountable?\nHow is the era of ESG accountability impacting corporate governance and the responsibilities of boards and legal advisors?\nHow can legal and compliance teams proactively mitigate ESG risks while driving sustainable value for their organizations?\nConfirm your place by July 31st and save $300\nRegister here: https://www.insidepractice.com/legal-esg-europe-2025",

So that is now reflected in all that Impressions does and has led to the creation of The Really Good Business – a coaching and mentoring service aimed at helping others grow their business and find greater joy through purposeful business practice. We are also launching the RGB Rebels Club which is a Bi-monthly meeting in partnership with Wigan and Leigh College.\nI regularly support other local businesses, Social Enterprises, charities and the councils in the areas we work in.

    "description": "In 2025 the corporate sustainability landscape is defined by regulatory uncertainty, unchartered climate risk and geopolitical shocks. The threat of deregulation compounded with the increased scrutiny on the commercial value of sustainability investments translates into real-world impact across complex global supply chains. Sustainability professionals are overrun, facing hurdles in data management, struggling with scalability, and navigating swings in trends.\r\n\r\nWith only 5 years until 2030, corporations are at a major inflection point. Interpreting unclear regulations, building compelling business cases and managing intricate supply chains effectively while addressing complex data challenges is paramount to future success. Developing a proactive approach and moving beyond compliance-driven reporting will be difficult and cannot be done alone.\r\n\r\nSustainability Europe 2025 offers you a unique opportunity to meet the moment and directly address these challenges. Join 500+ senior corporate executives as we provide practical strategies to navigate regulatory overload, build financially sound sustainability arguments, and drive real action. Through peer-to-peer roundtables, expert panels, and insightful fireside chats, you will gain clarity, create valuable networks, and acquire actionable tools to thrive in this evolving landscape. Attending will give you the tools to drive meaningful, value-creating sustainability strategies within your organisation.\r\n\r\nFor the past 24 years this, our flagship European event, has outlined the latest trends, tactics and opportunities in sustainable business. Join us at this critical juncture in October as we drive sustainable action and deliver corporate value.",

Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

Zwozny-Bestwick. I’m a non-traditional, eco-friendly Silversmith & Sculptor, working from my CRZyBest Shedquarters in Derby, creating tiny sculptures in metal clay and turning them into jewellery and accessories. Ensuring our world is a happy place is really important to me, so when making CRZyBest creations I always try my best to look after my customers and our planet too, which is why I make every effort to source my energy, tools and materials from sustainable and ethical sources. Before starting my business, I was a teacher for 20 years and I still very much enjoy supporting others in their businesses, creativity and sustainability journey. I’m a massive advocate of collaboration over competition and my favourite things to make are inspired by dogs and beer, so when I’m not creating in my Shedquarters, you can find me walking my dog or sharing stories with people in my favourite pub, so what better next step than to start hosting ‘People, Planet, Pint’ in The Flowerpot!\nOur Sponsor\nKRYSTAL\nare an award-winning, 100% renewably powered web hosting provider, with datacentres in the UK, US, & Europe.

    "title": "CATRINE project and TransCom online workshop",
    "description": "Speakers: Anna Agusti-Panareda (ECMWF)\n\nWorkshop Timings: 15:00 to 18:00 (BST), 16:00 to 19:00 (CEST)\n\n \nThe CATRINE project will host an online workshop to discuss a new TransCom model intercomparison protocol focusing on high resolution and the transport of CO2 from fossil fuel emissions.\nRegistration is open to the CATRINE project participants, the TransCom community plus invited guests. Registration will be moderated by the event organisers.\nBackground and motivation:\nMonitoring the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 from space has made great strides over the past decade, in particular in terms of imaging capability. Existing instruments for CO2 include NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) with continuous sampling of cloud-free regions along the orbital path at a resolution of 3 km2, and NASA's OCO-3 which introduced the possibility of performing successive side-by-side scans of small areas (∼80 × 80 km2). For CH4, the TROPOMI instrument on board Copernicus Sentinel-5P provides near-daily surface coverage of cloud-free regions at a spatial resolution of up to 38.5 km2. In addition, retrieval capabilities at higher spatial resolution are emerging, for instance from Copernicus Sentinel-2 or from Greenhouse Gases Satellite (GHGSat). In the near future, the Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission (CO2M) will extend the imaging capability of CO2 to a level comparable to the existing one for CH4 from TROPOMI. This new wealth of CO2 and CH4 satellite retrievals pushes the application of such satellite data towards the inference of anthropogenic emissions and absorptions, with target spatial scales much finer than the traditional zonal or subcontinental scales of global atmospheric inversions. In this regard, the current generation of global atmospheric transport models that operate primarily at resolutions coarser than one degree, risks obsolescence because most models cannot exploit the higher resolution information in which most of the anthropogenic signals reside.\nWith this new protocol, we aim at stimulating high-resolution tracer transport modelling by setting-up a dedicated intercomparison exercise. By “high-resolution”, we first mean the equivalent of a grid spacing of 100 km in the horizontal, or a minimum of 51,000 horizontal grid points (about 1 degree × 1 degree resolution in the Tropics) to pave the world. On the vertical, we put a simple lower limit of 50 layers between the surface and the top of the atmosphere, assuming that it implies sufficient refinement of the planetary boundary layer and around the tropopause for constructive intercomparison. Indeed, the model vertical profiles will be particularly looked at in this exercise. We expect that their evaluation for several tracers using observed profiles from tall towers, aircraft and AirCore soundings will shed some light into the current discrepancies of atmospheric inversions that assimilate column retrievals or air-sample measurements. \nSimulated tracers will be compared with each other, as will vertically integrated mass fluxes for total column. The reference observations will be diverse: ground-based or satellite tracer retrievals, air-sample measurements, as well as meteorological observations. We will define metrics to score the model performance. We will investigate how model configuration, like the vertical resolution, influences the model skill. The diagnostics will be applied to all tracers on weekly to monthly timescales, focusing on the impact of transport errors on the seasonal cycle at various layers and the total column. The correlation between the errors in the different layers with the error in the total column will support the attribution of the transport error.  The high-resolution simulation database will be the first of this sort and may serve various applications beyond the planned model evaluation, from, e.g., model uncertainty quantification to AI training. \nThis initiative originates from the European project Carbon Atmospheric Tracer Research to Improve Numerics and Evaluation (CATRINE), which funds the coordination of the intercomparison, as well as some contributors, but it is hoped that other partners in the world will join the momentum and contribute to the study with their respective model and expertise. \nThe meeting will include half a day of presentations and discussions of this new protocol to get input from the TransCom community.\nThe CATRINE project is funded by the European Union, Grant Agreement 101135000.\n \n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/461/",

It is open to all ECMWF forecast users around the world and provides an opportunity to give feedback on ECMWF forecast performance and available products and services, stay informed about ECMWF’s latest updates and plans, and connect with ECMWF and fellow users to share experiences and network.\nLocation\nUEF2025 will take place in two Bologna venues:\nRegione Emilia Romagna · Viale della Fiera, 8, 40127 Bologna BO, Italy\nTecnopolo Data Manifattura Emilia-Romagna, Via Stalingrado 84/3, 40128 Bologna\n2025 theme: Exploring the Past, Present and Future of ECMWF forecast products and services\nAs ECMWF celebrates its 50th anniversary, UEF2025 will explore the evolution of ECMWF forecast products and services over the years and into the future. Over the decades, improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP), forecast products, and services across meteorology, hydrology, air quality, and climate - including extreme event prediction - have supported Member and Co-operating States and the meteorological communities' ability to forecast and respond to weather and its impacts.\nCollaboration with Member and Co-operating States has been key to achieving ECMWF's goals, the valuable input, ideas and expertise driving its progress and success. Throughout this journey, ECMWF has remained committed to supporting users to make the most of its products and services through training, documentation, and dedicated support. By understanding user needs, ECMWF continues to design its products and services with a strong focus on usability and impact.\nECMWF ran its first operational medium-range forecast in 1979, its first operational ensemble predictions in 1992 and its first reanalysis (ERA-15) in 1993. To support these, a range of products and tools have been developed, including forecast products like the Extreme Forecast Index (EFI), verification scores to monitor progress, datasets like ERA5, and services such as ecCharts, training courses, and Jupyter Notebooks. These efforts, commonly in collaboration with National Meteorological Services of Member and Co-operating States, have helped to deliver maximum value to society. ECMWF's role in environmental services started in 2015 with the signing of the Copernicus agreement for ECMWF to deliver the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and support the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). This was followed in 2022 with the launch of Destination Earth (DestinE), further advancing ECMWF’s contributions to environmental prediction for extremes and climate.\nPresently, machine learning is a key component of ECMWF's work. A key milestone of this was the release of AIFS Single, ECMWF's first operational machine learning model, on 25 February 2025. Work continues not only on the machine-learning-based models themselves but also their evaluation compared to traditional NWP. Other exciting developments include ECMWF's Open Data strategy, facilitating more forecast data availability to the whole community. New products such as simulated satellite imagery, visibility meteograms and severe convection forecast products have recently been released with many existing products and services undergoing development and upgrades, often in collaboration with Member and Co-operating State National Meteorological Services.\nLooking to the future, the ECMWF 2025-2034 Strategy was released in February 2025, placing strong emphasis on impact and aiming to optimise, enhance and deliver world-leading quality products to meet users' needs through improved science and technology. A key priority remains ensuring that forecasts are not only accurate but also understandable and able to be effectively communicated to users across various sectors.\nAttendance\nRegistration has now closed.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/464/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Delving Into the FAIR Principles",
    "description": "The FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are a set of high-level guidelines for optimizing sharing digital resources in a machine-friendly environment. Their growing global acceptance and adoption by policymakers and organizations compels data professionals, projects, and repositories to demonstrate the level of FAIR-compliance (FAIRness) of their digital data, metadata, and infrastructures.\nDespite the straightforward acronym, the FAIR Principles are inherently complex, multi-dimensional, multi-layered, and multi-faceted, involving core concepts with numerous elements (as shown in the figure below). Implementing these principles involves navigating complexities and subjective interpretations. It must also account for domain-specific and application-specific dependencies, such as defining “rich metadata” and its implication to the Copernicus Climate Data catalogue.\nThis presentation takes a deep dive into the complexity of the FAIR Principles, identifies associated quality measures, and highlights several existing tools for evaluating data FAIRness. Dr. Peng will discuss their relevance to the Copernicus Climate Data catalogue, share the insights gained from assessing the FAIR compliance of NASA Earth science data products, and explore how a data catalogue can facilitate and support FAIR-compliance. This sets the stage for broader discussions on strategies to enhance the FAIRness of data products hosted by the Copernicus Climate Data Store and across ECMWF.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/471/",

The course is designed for users who are (or will be) using ECMWF products either directly as forecasting staff or in research and development work. The course aims to help users get maximum benefit from ECMWF's forecast products.\nThe programme combines lectures covering key components of the ECMWF forecasting system and products with interactive, hands-on sessions. Working in small groups alongside expert trainers, participants will analyse case studies to assess forecast performance. Participants will also learn how to effectively use web applications for data visualisation.\nTo ensure participants are well-prepared and able to fully engage with the course content, a set of pre-course activities will be required. These activities, estimated to take up to 8 hours of self-paced study, include completing online e-learning modules, creating a poster showcasing how ECMWF products are currently used in their work, and contributing to online discussion forums. The completion of these tasks will ensure all participants have the knowledge to get the most out of the in-person part of the course and it will also help the trainers to better understand what participants would like to achieve and discuss.\nThis training is in-person, and all lectures will be given in English.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/472/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Forecast asymmetries and fragile data flows: challenges and responsibilities for S2S services",
    "description": "\nForecast skill is unevenly distributed across regions and scales, with major implications for the design of sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) services. A recent study (Keane et al., accepted) demonstrates a clear crossover in model skill at 5–7 days lead time: mid-latitudes favour short-term, fine-scale forecasts, while tropical regions exhibit higher skill at longer lead times and coarser spatial scales. This pattern holds for both traditional numerical models and machine learning systems (which surprised us), suggesting that it reflects fundamental atmospheric dynamics rather than modelling artefacts.\nA companion study (Dunn-Sigouin et al., accepted) shows that spatial aggregation improves forecast accuracy and extends usable lead time. This is especially true for daily rather than weekly accumulations. I will illustrate these findings using Storm Hans (2023), likely the most expensive weather-related disaster in Norwegian history, to show how aggregation would have improved the usefulness of early warnings for extreme rainfall.\nTogether, these papers point to a need for region-specific forecast strategies. In tropical regions—especially in Africa—this means investing both in improving short-term capabilities and in harnessing the relative strength of longer-range probabilistic forecasts. Yet these efforts face growing headwinds. U.S. budget cuts have disrupted FEWS NET and threaten CHIRPS and key model data streams such as GFS and CFS, on which many African meteorological services depend.\nIn this talk, I will reflect on how these scientific and infrastructural challenges intersect in practice, as well as why ECMWF and European institutions may now be called upon to fill emerging global data gaps and support more equitable access to forecast information.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/481/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Assessing the impact of model biases on sub-seasonal forecast skill",
    "description": "Speakers: Frederic Vitart\n\n\nThe impact of model biases on sub-seasonal forecast skill has been evaluated in the ECMWF sub-seasonal forecasting system using a relaxation experiment where the nudging was performed towards bias corrected integrations of the same model. The relaxation was performed regionally or globally but only for the very large scale. Results indicate that this methodology significantly reduces model biases over the areas where the nudging was applied as expected. Experiments with global relaxation or with a relaxation applied only over the North Pole or only over the Tropics display significantly improved forecast skill at a lead time of 3 to 4 weeks, particularly over the northern Extratropics, where sub-seasonal forecast skill has been stagnant at this time range over the past 20 years in the ECMWF operational sub-seasonal forecasting system. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the largest positive impact is obtained with a 2-day relaxation timescale in the Tropics and 5-day in the Extratropics.  An analysis of the North Pole relaxation experiment shows that the polar relaxation impacts biases outside the region of nudging, such as the representation of the sub-tropical jet stream in the ECMWF model, reducing mid-latitude geopotential height bias and leading to a slight improvement in MJO teleconnections over the northern Extratropics. These results indicate that there is a large potential for improving dynamical sub-seasonal forecasting skill in weeks 3 and 4 in Extratropical regions, which could be achieved using online or offline bias correction.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/482/",

    "title": "Informal Seminar: Soil-moisture atmosphere coupling hotspots and their importance for sub-seasonal and seasonal prediction",
    "description": "Speakers: Jonathan Day\n\n\nDue to its inherent long-memory and profound role in modulating surface exchanges of heat and moisture, soil moisture is a major source of potential forecast skill at sub-seasonal and seasonal timescales. In some regions, known as “hotspots”, soil moisture can influence near-surface temperature and precipitation locally, but can also influence remote areas by exciting quasi-stationary Rossby waves in the atmosphere.\nIn this talk I will give an overview of these important predictability mechanisms and discuss a recent study which highlighted the quality of land-surface initial conditions and the current representation of these hotspots as limiting factors in the skill of forecasting systems contributing to the C3S multi-model outlook. Regions where forecasting systems overestimate the strength of soil-moisture atmosphere coupling tend to have particularly low skill.\nI will also discuss ongoing efforts at ECMWF to address these limitations through improved land-surface data assimilation and increased model complexity, as part of the CERISE project. One notable development is the incorporation of time-varying vegetation, which is held static in current operational systems but is thought to provide a source of predictability at seasonal timescales.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/484/",

    "description": "\nPresenters\nSimon Lang, Senior Scientist in the Earth System Modeling Section\nMaartje Kuilman, Analyst in User Services Section\nDescription\nOn Tuesday 1 July 2025, the first version of the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS) Ensemble model will be released and supported operationally. This release marks another milestone in ECMWF history, as AIFS ENS v1 will be the first AIFS ensemble model to be made fully operational.\nAIFS ENS, v1 model will not be an upgrade of currently experimental diffusion AIFS ENS model. It is a first version of a new model that is trained using a version of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), a loss function that helps ensure the forecasts are both accurate and well-calibrated.\nIn addition to operationalisation of AIFS ENS, v1 will bring several new data and graphical probabilistic prodcuts available in the EMCWF Open charts platform.\nIn this webinar Simon Lang, Senior Scientist in the Earth System Modeling Section, introduced AIFS ENS v1 model and its performance, and Maartje Kuilman, Analyst in User Services Section presented available data and products and the ways to obtain them. The presentation was be followed by a Q&A session.  \nThis webinar took place on Tuesday, 24 June 2025; 10:00-11:00 BST.\nA recording of the webinar is now available from the Implementation of AIFS ENS v1 page.\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/487/",

    "title": "5th ECMWF-ESA Machine Learning Workshop",
    "description": "\nWorkshop motivation and goals\nThe use of Machine Learning (ML) technologies is becoming prevalent in an ever-growing number of applications in Earth System Observation and Prediction (ESOP). Additionally, the scale, complexity and sophistication of the ML technologies applied in ESOP has also increased considerably over the last few years, reflecting the growing uptake of ML ideas in the ESOP communities and benefiting from increased interest of ML domain scientists and of large commercial actors. This trend has reached the stage where end-to-end data-driven workflows are being considered for future operational weather and climate prediction systems. On the other hand, questions remain about the ability of purely data driven methods to advance the science underlying the slow but steady progress of ESOP capabilities based on physics-based algorithms.  \nIn parallel with the scientific developments brought about by ML, at the same time there is a shift in computational platforms for High Performance Computing (HPC) from CPU-based to GPU/TPU-based systems. ML applications benefit from this trend as they are typically developed on GPU/TPU machines, while the process of porting codes currently used for weather and climate prediction to the new computing architectures is laborious. Looking further ahead, even more disruptive technologies are appearing on the horizon, such as quantum, edge, or neuromorphic computing.  \nThe fifth edition of the ECMWF–ESA Workshop on Machine Learning for Earth Observation and Prediction will provide an up-to-date snapshot of the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field and a forum of discussion and interaction among worldwide scientists and practitioners about the current opportunities and challenges presented by the use of ML technologies for ESOP.   \nThematic areas\nContributions are welcome in all areas connected to the application of ML technologies to ESOP applications, with a particular focus on the thematic areas below.     \n\nHybrid ML-Physics based systems for Data Assimilation and Weather and Climate prediction \nEnd-to-end ML systems for Data Assimilation and Weather and Climate Prediction \nMachine Learning applications for Earth system observations \nHigh-performance and new computing technologies for ML applications in ESOP \nMachine Learning for Digital Twins of the Earth system \n\nTimeline\n\n30 June 2025: Announcement \n15 September 2025: Registration and Abstract submission open \n1 December 2025: Abstract submission deadline \n10 January 2026: Notification of Abstract acceptance \n1 March 2026: Registration for in person participation closes \n\n \n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/488/",

    "description": "\nThe WeatherGenerator project will host a hackathon to project participants on 27th to 29th August 2025 in Bonn, Germany.\nHackathon aims\nThe Weather Generator team will present the core model of the WeatherGenerator and show the project participants how this model can be leveraged to a downstream application.\nThis will be an in-person hands-on event with the goal that each application can run and fine-tune the model.\nThe hackathon will open with presentations and discussions of the project models, followed by how to run the applications. The work on the applications themselves will then start, which will be clustered around specific topics.\nRegistration to the hackathon will be moderated by the organisers and places are limited.\nProject background and motivation\nThe aim of the WeatherGenerator project is to build an advanced generative Foundation Model of the Earth system – that will serve as a new Digital Twin for Destination Earth. The WeatherGenerator model will be based on representation learning and aims to create a general and versatile tool that models the dynamics of the Earth system based on a large variety of Earth system data. At the same time, it also aims to integrate observations and simulations at a previously unseen level and scale.\nThis project brings together Europe's leading scientific groups and research institutes, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and industry partners in the area of Earth system modelling, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning to build the WeatherGenerator as a new Digital Twin of DestinE. Once trained, the WeatherGenerator will be applied for selected high-impact applications in the energy, food, water and health sectors. The WeatherGenerator will lead to key innovations in weather and climate science and machine learning to enable Europe to establish and defend leadership with respect to machine-learning based Earth system modelling\nThe WeatherGenerator  project is funded by the European Union, Grant Agreement 101187947.\nMore details on the WeatherGenerator can be found at https://weathergenerator.eu/\n\nhttps://events.ecmwf.int/event/489/",

    "title": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts",
    "description": "IAU Symposium 402: Massive Stars Across Redshifts in the Era of JWST and Large-Scale Surveys\n\nScientific Motivation\n\nAlthough massive stars are crucial in solving the cosmic puzzle as they are key contributors of ionizing radiation, metals, cosmic rays and dust and, when they die, of neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves, many competing factors, are thought to influence their observed properties and challenge our understanding of how these stars evolve and contribute to the Universe.\n\nThe Massive Stars Commission (G2) of the IAU’s Stars and Stellar Physics Division regularly organizes a symposium, typically every 4 years, to present the latest research findings in the field, discuss the status of current research in massive stars, and chart the way forward for future research. The first meeting was in Argentina in 1971, and in the last decade we organized “Massive Stars: from Alpha to Omega” in Greece (2013), “IAUS 329: The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars” in New Zealand (2016), and “IAUS 361: Massive Stars Near and Far” in Ireland (2020, postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic).\n\nSince the last symposium organized by the G2 commission (IAUS 361, 2022), the James Webb Space Telescope is dramatically changing our understanding of the early Universe. Important discoveries at high redshift have been made, including galaxies that are too massive for their age, systems with oxygen abundances typical of much later epochs of the Universe, and possible signatures of Pop III stars at z=10. Massive stars, through population synthesis codes,  \nare critical to simulate the evolution and early chemical enrichment of galaxies in the infant Universe, and to analyse the observed spectra of these very high redshift systems.\n\nMany improvements have been made on individual stars, close binaries and population synthesis models.\n\nA better understanding of the impact of massive stars on their surroundings has been achieved and, in addition, analysis techniques are also increasingly sophisticated. These involve accounting for improved or more complete physics, better atomic data, and/or evolving from 1-dimensional to 3D models in the simulations of stellar structure and winds.\n\nDespite the large progress, however, outstanding open questions on massive star evolution and winds remain (e.g. the role of metallicity, true mass loss rates, internal transport mechanisms and magnetic fields to name a few). The view of massive star evolution also needs to be reconciled with the view of the massive star graveyard drawn by gravitational wave experiments. These issues, to be discussed in this symposium, need to be solved to properly account for the role of massive stars across cosmic time, and to maximize the return of empirical datasets and models in the era of JWST and large surveys (SDSS V Mappers, SKA, and Rubin/LSST, among others).\n\nFortunately, the field of massive stars is entering a new era also enabled by large scale spectroscopic surveys. By targeting vast samples of massive stars in the Milky Way and our neighbours the Magellanic Clouds, IACOB, WEAVE, 4MOST, SDSS IV APOGEE, HST-ULLYSES, and VLT-XShootU, as well as complementary observations, will soon enable detailed constraints on theory obtained thanks to quantitative spectroscopic analyses. In addition, new promising research areas are emerging, such as massive-star asteroseismology, that is providing an unprecedented view of their interior. This symposium will enable the experts from complementary communities to gauge the progress that has been made so far and identify areas that still require improvements. Ideas for new technology may also emerge.\n\nVenue and Lodging\n\nIAUS 402 will take place at Hotel Coral y Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.",

    "description": "Czech Space Week 2025 will span from October 20 to October 26 across multiple venues in the Czech Republic. This event stands as the largest and most comprehensive space festival in the country, uniting companies, startups, academics, and government stakeholders under a singular mission. Since its establishment in 2018, Czech Space Week has evolved into a critical platform designed to accelerate innovation, collaboration, and investment within the Czech and broader European space sectors.\n\n**Core Events and Strategic Focus**\n===================================\n\nThe festival features a curated lineup of events catering to industry professionals and the general public. The flagship **Space2Business** conference showcases collaborative opportunities, technological breakthroughs, and market trends shaping space-related enterprises, both domestically and internationally. Complementing this, the **Copernicus User Forum** convenes experts focusing on Earth observation technologies and their applications, emphasizing the region’s commitment to leveraging space data for environmental and security purposes.\n\nMoreover, Czech Space Week highlights pressing themes such as space defense and international cooperation. A notable seminar titled “Defending European Interests in Space” addresses strategic challenges linked to space security, particularly in light of recent geopolitical tensions. The festival also fosters global dialogue by including sessions aimed at strengthening partnerships with Indo-Pacific space actors.\n\nEmpowering Diversity and Public Engagement\n\nCzech Space Week actively promotes gender diversity through the **Space4Women** initiative. This platform spotlights female leadership and encourages greater inclusion across all space industry levels, from research to entrepreneurship. Public outreach remains vital, with educational workshops, exhibitions, and family-friendly programs designed to inspire youth and engage wider society.\n\nThe week culminates with the elegant **Space Gala**, celebrating achievements and fostering networking among key players in government, industry, and academia. This multifaceted approach ensures that Czech Space Week functions as more than a conference: it serves as a vibrant nexus where innovation meets policy, and science intersects with commerce.\n\n### Czech Republic’s Ascending Role in Space\n\nThe Czech Republic distinguishes itself as one of the most successful newcomers within the European Space Agency (ESA), actively contributing to around 500 ESA projects. Its strengths lie in satellite technology, launch vehicle development, and Earth observation missions. Czech companies and subcontractors are highly engaged in these domains, demonstrating a competitive edge alongside Western European nations.\n\nBy hosting such a diverse and well-structured festival, Czech Space Week fortifies the country’s position as a dynamic and influential player in the global space economy. The 2025 edition not only spotlights national achievements but also accelerates strategic partnerships and innovation transfer, aligning with Europe’s broader space ambitions.",

    "title": "International School on Space Optics ISSO 2025",
    "description": "**ISSO 2025 will take place from 27 – 31 October 2025 at ESA-ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.**\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe International School on Space Optics is an event that targets to serve the community of young engineers and scientists who are already active or have the aspiration to work in the field of Spaceborne Optics. It offers an intensive 5-days immersion program of lectures, design project and visits to space-related facilities. The course can be seen as a “compressed” 1-year class on Space Optics which would have been part of a Master Program in Spaceborne Technologies and Applications. It will allow 360 degrees exposure to all disciplines or optical engineering in space. A Certificate of Attendance will be provided to any participant that has been present consistently throughout the Course.\n\nThe first ISSO was organised as a “Winter College on Space Optics” in February 2015 at the UNESCO International Centre for Theoretical Physics – ICTP within the frame of the “2015-International Year of Light”.  Following this event it was decided to establish the ISSO as a systematic biannual event. In 2017 the ISSO was hosted at ESTEC. In 2019 the ISSO was hosted at ENEA in Rome, Italy. And ISSO 2021 was hosted online.\n\nIn 2025 the School will be held only physically in ESTEC with no option for on-line attendance.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nThe school organization is committed to providing an environment that is conducive to the free and robust exchange of scientific ideas. This environment requires that all participants be treated with equal consideration and respect. The participants are therefore expected to conduct themselves professionally and respectfully. All forms of bullying, discrimination, and harassment are prohibited. This policy applies to every individual at the event, whether attendee, speaker or other.\n\nHow many people will participate?\n\n80 people will participate in ISSO 2025. The selection is based on merit and expected benefit for the student.\n\nWhy we do it?\n\nEngineers and Scientists working on any discipline of spaceborne optics tend frequently to be very specialised in the narrow field of their first work missing opportunities in serving other disciplines. Also, optical engineers who have not yet engaged in any kind of activity in Space do not have a complete understanding of where their skills could be applied. The school will provide a 360- degree overview of the broad area of Space Optics covering Applications, Instrumentation and Technologies opening hence the horizons and opportunities for the young engineers/scientists to assess better all available opportunities.\n\nISSO is a sister event of the International Conference on Space Optics – ICSO and it is organised biannually in alternative years than ICSO.\n\nThe ICSO proceedings are freely and readily available on the ICSO proceedings site of the SPIE Digital Library.\n\nCEAS Space Journal\n\nThe CEAS Space Journal includes a distinct field on “Optical, Optoelectronics and Photonics” and welcomes papers of ICSO in an extended version of the conference paper including theoretical analysis. Consider an electronic submission through the Journal [website](https://www.springer.com/journal/12567).\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThanks to the support of sponsors the fees for the students will be kept to a minimum registration fee.\n\nWho should attend?\n\nYoung engineers or scientists with a background in any field of Optics, Optoelectronics or Photonics. Background should be demonstrated by:\n\n* a Masters or PhD degree in any Optics discipline\n* actively pursuing a PhD in any Optics discipline\n* working as a researcher in any Optics discipline in a university or research centre or industry\n\nWithout having a strict age limit it is expected that the participants will be in generally younger than 40 years old and with limited experience in the field of Space Optics.\n\nCertificate of Attendance\n\nAt the conclusion of the School a “Certificate of Attendance” signed by the School Directors, will be awarded to all students attending the full programme of lectures and visits.\n\nAcademic accreditation\n\nAcademic institutions can recognize the School for its merit. Notice that the University of Padova’s PhD course on Sciences Technologies and Measurements for Space (STMS) [PhD Course – Dottorato | CISAS “G.Colombo” (unipd.it)](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/QHywCAngcyYm3vt8JPFy) accredits the ISSO with 2 Credit units ([https://www.study.eu/article/what-is-the-ects-european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fBMqCBgjCQoZ9gUNU6Ib)).\n\nYoung Space Optics Professionals\n\nWhy don’t you ask our “alumnae” for a first hand account of what to expect from attending ISSO. [LinkedIn Link of YSOP.](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9093885/)",
