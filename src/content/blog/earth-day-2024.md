On 22 April 1970, millions of people across the United States united for the first Earth Day, marking the birth of the modern environmental movement. Since then, Earth Day has evolved into a global phenomenon, mobilising billions of individuals worldwide to protect our planet. This year, as we mark Earth Day 2024, the focus is on one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time: plastic pollution in our oceans.

Marine litter, particularly plastic waste, poses a grave threat to ecosystems, marine life, and human health. Every year, millions of tonnes of solid waste find their way into our oceans, wreaking havoc on delicate ecosystems and endangering marine species. Plastic production has skyrocketed in recent decades, with approximately ten million tonnes of plastic entering our oceans annually – equivalent to a fresh truckload of plastic dumped every single minute. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for action to address the scourge of plastic pollution.

Innovations in detecting plastic marine litter from space offer a glimmer of hope in our fight against plastic pollution. The European Space Agency’s Discovery Element funded 25 innovative projects dedicated to detecting and tracking seaborne plastic litter using satellite technology. These projects represent a crucial step forward in our ability to monitor and manage marine litter on a global scale. By harnessing the power of remote sensing from space, researchers can better understand the scope of the problem and develop targeted solutions to mitigate plastic pollution.

While current satellite sensors can detect large accumulations of floating debris, advancements are needed to improve spatial resolution and sensitivity for detecting plastic litter specifically. The campaign highlighted the potential of airborne and ground-based remote sensing technologies, paving the way for the development of commercial monitoring services. Additionally, there is growing interest in extending monitoring efforts from the sea and coastlines to rivers and polluted lands, embracing a holistic approach to remote sensing.

As we mark Earth Day 2024, EARTHDAY.ORG‘s theme of “Planet vs. Plastics” resonates deeply with the global community. Our commitment to ending plastics for the sake of human and planetary health is unwavering. We demand a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040 and advocate for urgent action to phase out single-use plastics, push for a strong UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution, and put an end to the fast fashion industry’s reliance on plastic.

The Planet vs. Plastics initiative unites people from all walks of life in a collective effort to build a plastic-free future. From students to businesses, governments to NGOs, we are all called to action to champion sustainability and combat plastic pollution. By promoting public awareness, phasing out single-use plastics, ending fast fashion, and investing in innovative solutions, we can pave the way towards a cleaner, healthier planet for generations to come.

As we celebrate Earth Day 2024, let us recommit ourselves to protecting our planet and ensuring a sustainable future for all. Together, we can turn the tide on plastic pollution and create a world where nature thrives, and humanity prospers. Join us in our mission to build a plastic-free planet – because when it comes to the health of our planet, there’s no time to waste.
