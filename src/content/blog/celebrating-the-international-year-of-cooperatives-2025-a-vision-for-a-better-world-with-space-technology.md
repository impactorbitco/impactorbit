As we look ahead to 2025, the world will celebrate the United Nations’ declaration of the International Year of Cooperatives (IYC 2025). This significant year highlights the crucial role that cooperatives play in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the theme “Cooperatives Build a Better World.” At the intersection of cooperative development and sustainable innovation, space technology offers unique opportunities to help build a more inclusive, resilient, and environmentally conscious future for all.

## The Vital Role of Cooperatives in Sustainable Development

Cooperatives are powerful agents of social, economic, and environmental transformation. The values of participatory decision-making, equality, solidarity, and community involvement directly align with the SDGs, making cooperatives essential players in global efforts to tackle poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Through their member-driven structures, cooperatives enable people to work together towards common goals, fostering resilience and empowering communities. Whether in agriculture, healthcare, renewable energy, or technology, cooperatives provide sustainable solutions to meet the challenges of our rapidly changing world.

The IYC 2025 presents an opportunity to celebrate these contributions while encouraging growth, innovation, and collaboration in cooperative enterprises worldwide.

## Space Technology: A Catalyst for Cooperative Growth

Space technology has long been a field marked by innovation, exploration, and collaboration. As the world faces complex global challenges, space technology can be a key enabler of cooperative enterprises, providing sustainable solutions that address the SDGs. By integrating space technology with the cooperative model, we can open new doors to a more sustainable and inclusive world.

1. Enabling Connectivity: Space-based communication technologies can connect remote and underserved communities, providing access to critical resources like education, healthcare, and market opportunities. Cooperatives, especially in rural or isolated areas, can leverage satellite networks to overcome connectivity barriers and offer their members greater access to information and services.

1. Climate Action and Earth Observation: Space-based technologies such as satellite imagery and Earth observation systems play an essential role in monitoring and responding to climate change. Cooperatives focused on agriculture, forestry, and disaster management can use these tools to better manage natural resources, track environmental changes, and implement more sustainable practices. Through cooperation, these groups can share data and insights to enhance climate resilience and sustainability.

1. Sustainable Energy Solutions: Space technology can also play a pivotal role in advancing renewable energy sources. For example, space-based solar power systems—such as those explored through the concept of Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP)—could provide clean, virtually unlimited energy to support local cooperatives in remote areas. By harnessing the power of space, cooperatives can ensure a more sustainable energy future for their members and communities.

1. Innovation in Technology and Research: Through partnerships and cooperative initiatives, space agencies, research institutions, and local cooperatives can collaborate to drive innovation. The development of new space technologies—such as satellite-based sensors, AI-driven data analytics, and autonomous systems—can be leveraged by cooperatives to enhance their business models and improve services for their members. This collaboration could also fuel further technological advancements to address specific societal challenges.

## Celebrating Collaboration for a Better Future

The International Year of Cooperatives 2025 serves as a reminder that through collective action, we can tackle the challenges that confront us and build a better, more sustainable world. By combining the cooperative model with space technology, we can unlock new possibilities for growth, inclusivity, and environmental stewardship.

The role of cooperatives in promoting innovation and sustainability will continue to be essential as we strive to achieve the SDGs by 2030. The coming year presents a unique opportunity to showcase how space technology and the cooperative spirit can work hand-in-hand to build a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

Together, we can make a difference. Let us celebrate IYC 2025 by embracing the power of cooperation, innovation, and space technology as we continue to work towards a better world for future generations.
