name: 'Celebrating International Dark Sky Week: Embracing Dark and Quiet Skies'
excerpt: "International Dark Sky Week is a global celebration of the dark and natural night—a time to appreciate the beauty and importance of our unadulterated skies. In a world where artificial light pervades every corner of our existence, the natural darkness of night often goes unnoticed, misunderstood, or even feared."

In late October 2025, **Hurricane Melissa**, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds exceeding 260 km/h, approached Jamaica, causing widespread alarm. Storm surges of up to 4 metres, up to 1 metre of rainfall, and the threat of flooding and landslides meant the island was facing one of its most severe disasters in recent history.

This crisis highlights the growing role of **space-based technologies, disaster preparedness frameworks, and communications strategies** in saving lives and maintaining resilient communities. At **Green Orbit Digital**, we work at the intersection of **space capability, sustainability, and strategic communication**, helping organisations and governments turn complex data into actionable insights.


## **The Science of Disaster: Why Space Data Matters**

Satellites are now central to disaster risk management, providing continuous monitoring and predictive capabilities. In Hurricane Melissa’s case:

- **Storm Tracking and Forecasting** – Copernicus Sentinel-3 imagery allowed meteorologists to track the storm’s path, cloud-top temperatures, and wind intensity in near real-time.
- **Damage Assessment** – High-resolution imagery from Sentinel-1 and WorldView-2 enabled rapid evaluation of infrastructure and building damage in Jamaica’s Saint Elizabeth and Black River districts.
- **Flood and Landslide Prediction** – Space-based sensors informed models predicting flash floods and landslides, crucial for evacuation planning.
- **Logistics Optimisation** – Satellite data guided the deployment of mobile warehouses, generators, and emergency supplies by humanitarian agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP).

## **UN-SPIDER: Global Coordination for Disaster Response**

The **United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER)** plays a vital role in connecting satellite technology with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Through its offices in **Vienna, Beijing, and Bonn**, UN-SPIDER supports governments by:

- Providing technical advisory support on accessing Earth Observation and satellite communications
- Offering workshops and training courses to strengthen capacity in disaster-prone regions
- Facilitating knowledge exchange on early warning systems and anticipatory action
- Supporting developing countries to integrate space-based information into national disaster strategies

Melissa’s impact across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic demonstrated the effectiveness of such global networks in **accelerating coordinated, evidence-based responses**.


## **Hurricane Melissa: Coordinating Humanitarian Response**

Humanitarian partners faced complex logistical challenges due to Jamaica’s **mountainous terrain and limited staging areas**. The response relied on a combination of **prepositioned resources, satellite imagery, and rapid communications**:

- **Emergency Food and Supplies** – WFP airlifted 2,000 emergency food kits from Barbados, enough for 6,000 people for ten days.
- **Mobile Infrastructure** – Generators, mobile warehouses, and satellite communications units were prepositioned to maintain critical operations.
- **Cash-Based Assistance** – Anticipatory e-money distributions ensured households could access essentials before the storm hit.
- **Telecommunications Support** – Satellite and terrestrial networks were maintained to provide reliable internet and communications for local government and NGOs.

This approach underscores the importance of **data-driven planning, proactive logistics, and strategic communication** in managing disasters.


## **Green Orbit Digital: Bridging Space Data and Communications**

At **Green Orbit Digital**, we specialise in turning complex datasets—such as satellite imagery, environmental monitoring, and predictive analytics—into **clear, actionable messaging** for governments, NGOs, and private sector partners.

Our work spans:

- **Disaster Preparedness Campaigns** – Translating space-based insights into community guidance, evacuation messaging, and public awareness content.
- **Stakeholder Engagement** – Connecting humanitarian organisations, local authorities, and private actors to strengthen response networks.
- **Sustainability Integration** – Using space-informed insights to guide climate-resilient planning, energy efficiency, and sustainable urban development.

In Leicester, for example, we collaborate with initiatives like **Space Park Leicester, NCEO, and EarthSense** to monitor environmental risks, including flooding and urban heat islands, demonstrating how **space technology and strategic communications intersect locally and globally**.

## **Lessons from Hurricane Melissa for Future Disaster Management**

The hurricane emphasises key principles that can be applied to disaster preparedness worldwide:

1. **Proactive Planning Saves Lives** – Prepositioning resources and issuing timely alerts reduces human vulnerability.
2. **Cross-Sector Collaboration Is Essential** – Governments, NGOs, and private companies must coordinate to deliver effective aid.
3. **Clear Communication Is Critical** – Communities need accurate, accessible information to make informed decisions.
4. **Sustainability Enhances Resilience** – Infrastructure and logistics must be environmentally sustainable and robust against future risks.

These lessons are relevant not only in the Caribbean but also in urban centres like **Leicester**, where space data informs **flood risk management, energy efficiency, and climate-adaptive city planning**.


## **Taking Action: Building Resilient Communities**

Organisations and governments can strengthen disaster risk management through:

- **Integrating Space Data** – Monitoring weather, environmental risks, and infrastructure vulnerabilities
- **Strategic Communications** – Translating technical insights into actionable messaging for the public
- **Cross-Sector Partnerships** – Ensuring collaboration between humanitarian agencies, governments, and private actors
- **Sustainable Urban Planning** – Developing resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding extreme events

**Green Orbit Digital** empowers organisations to apply these principles by creating **impactful communications campaigns**, leveraging space data and analytics to **support emergency preparedness, climate resilience, and community engagement**.
