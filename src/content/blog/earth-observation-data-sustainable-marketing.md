The National Earth Observation Conference (NEOC) 2024, held at the National STEM Centre in York, was a significant event for industry leaders, researchers, and policymakers. The conference focused on the transformative potential of Earth Observation (EO) data across various sectors. This year’s presentations highlighted how EO data can tackle pressing challenges, including climate change and resource management.

## Insights from Our Presentation

In a session titled “The Business of EO,” Director of Green Orbit Digital, Ryan Laird, presented “Utilising Earth Observation Data to Drive Sustainable Marketing and Consumer Behaviour.” This talk explored how businesses can harness EO data to craft marketing campaigns that appeal to eco-conscious consumers. As sustainability becomes central to corporate agendas, EO data provides a valuable tool for substantiating sustainability claims, building consumer trust, and driving meaningful behavioural change.

## Key Takeaways from Our Talk

- Transforming Data into Engagement: EO data helps visualise real-time environmental impacts, making the effects of consumption more tangible. For instance, EO data can illustrate deforestation linked to palm oil production, clarifying the environmental consequences of consumer choices. This approach can significantly enhance consumer engagement in sustainability initiatives.

- Localised Campaigns for Maximum Impact: EO data enables businesses to tailor campaigns to address regional environmental concerns. We shared a case study of a global fashion brand that used EO data to monitor water usage in key manufacturing regions. By highlighting local water scarcity, the brand effectively connected with consumers on a regional level while promoting responsible practices.

- Building Trust Through Transparency: Transparency is increasingly demanded by consumers. EO data can substantiate claims about product sourcing, production, and environmental impact. Our talk emphasised how transparency builds trust, helping brands stand out in the crowded eco-friendly market.

- Empowering Consumers with Interactive Tools: EO data allows businesses to create interactive platforms that track the environmental footprint of purchases. We discussed an example where a food company developed an app to monitor the carbon footprint of individual ingredients, encouraging more informed and sustainable consumer choices.

- EO Data as a CSR and Brand Differentiator: Integrating EO data into sustainability efforts supports Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals and enhances brand credibility. Companies using EO data to verify their environmental claims gain a competitive edge and contribute to broader sustainability efforts.

- Collaboration with Policymakers: Our presentation also explored how businesses can work with policymakers to ensure accuracy and transparency in sustainability claims, fostering a more robust market for eco-friendly products.

Related Talks and Broader ContextNEOC 2024 featured several sessions showcasing innovative uses of EO data. In the same “The Business of EO” session, Gareth Thomas from RAL Space presented a satellite-driven solar energy monitoring system. This system uses EO data to optimise solar photovoltaic installations, demonstrating how satellite data can enhance efficiency and sustainability in the energy sector.Another highlight was Susan Mecklenburg’s keynote from the European Space Agency (ESA). She discussed ESA’s Climate Change Initiative and the new CLIMATE-SPACE programme, which uses EO data for global climate resilience and policy-making. This initiative underscores the growing role of EO data in supporting international sustainability goals.Looking Ahead: From Data to ActionThe presentation of “Utilising Earth Observation Data to Drive Sustainable Marketing and Consumer Behaviour” resonated with many at NEOC 2024, particularly those aiming to integrate sustainability into their business strategies. EO data offers a unique opportunity to develop transparent, credible, and data-driven marketing strategies that drive real environmental impact.The discussions at NEOC 2024 highlighted the diverse applications of EO data, from monitoring air quality and energy efficiency to supporting climate policy. As these technologies advance, businesses can leverage EO data to enhance their sustainability credentials and drive tangible consumer behaviour changes, contributing to global environmental goals.
