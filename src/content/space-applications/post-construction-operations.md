description: >
  Critical infrastructures such as dams, bridges, factories etc. can be damaged in case of Earth’s surface deformation. Earth observation offers solutions for the monitoring of infrastructure stability and for the provision of situation awareness as it can accurately monitor land deformation and to detect minor changes (e.g., building subsidence). The stability of critical infrastructure is monitored also via high-precision GNSS methods, e.g., by post-processing of static relative GNSS observations at field control points (established directly into or in the vicinity of the object) with station data from local or global CORS networks. In addition, GNSS data may be utilized to feed various smart sensors, mounted into the infrastructure body for real-time stability monitoring.
