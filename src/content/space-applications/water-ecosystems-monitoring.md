description: >
  Water ecosystems monitoring leverages satellite imagery, remote sensing, and IoT sensors to track the health of rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal areas. These solutions enable real-time monitoring of water quality, biodiversity, and pollution levels, supporting conservation efforts, sustainable resource management, and regulatory compliance. Insights from space-based technologies help guide policy, improve ecosystem resilience, and safeguard freshwater and marine biodiversity.
