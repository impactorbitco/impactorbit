description: >
  Prior to the selection of a power plant site, Earth observation can contribute to the assessment of the potential of a given area based on the analysis of historical data for example, wind, solar irradiation, ocean currents, ocean temperature (e.g., for OTEC or SWAC) and snow cover. During the exploitation phase, Earth observation can help calculating daily production estimates based on plant characteristics coupled with relevant forecasts. This includes for instance solar plant production estimates based on solar irradiation forecasts or hydropower production estimates based on snow cover smelting.
