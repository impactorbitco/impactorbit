title: "Dark vessel monitoring"
markets: "Maritime and Inland Waterways"
description: >
  GNSS-enabled long-range identification and tracking as well as AIS or VMS provide the means to monitor and track suspicious vessels. When those vessels turn off or disable their own AIS or VMS, Earth observation data provides enhanced situational awareness that can be used by dedicated maritime authorities to monitor and track “dark vessels” through Earth observation imagery and SAR data.
