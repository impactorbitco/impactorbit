  Thanks to its capacity to detect surface changes, Earth observation can support the monitoring in near-real-time of the progress achieved anywhere on the construction site. It can also help verifying the alignment between actual building and original plans. While also providing typical surveying techniques on the site, GNSS is an ultimate supplier of positioning and orientation data for heavy machinery (graders, dozers, excavators, compactors), which can be used for either semi-automatic (GNSS serves as a guide to the operator) or fully automatic operations (GNSS data is directly fused into the machine hydraulic control). For the needs of BIM, GNSS can feed the model with high accuracy positioning data of all relevant construction assets.
