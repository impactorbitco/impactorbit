description: >
  Currently, GNSS is used in smart mobility applications to optimize the network capacity by managing tram locations or to provide real time information to passengers such as the estimated arrival time of a tram at a designated station. GNSS has started to be used for advanced applications, such as automatic speed limitation, ensuring that the tram speed is lower than a customer-defined speed limit in a specific area. It is also used for maintenance or on-board energy management, ensuring that the tram’s on-board battery has sufficient energy level before passing a section without external power supply.
