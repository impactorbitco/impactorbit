title: "Risk assessment for energy assets"
markets: "Energy & raw materials"
description: >
  Energy assets are exposed to a variety of natural risks which can put at danger the people working on site or, damage equipment or negatively impact production. Earth observation can contribute to the assessment of the level of risk to prevent/mitigate the effects of adverse events on the exploitation of energy (incl. the protection of workers maintaining offshore wind platforms for instance). Relevant Earth observation-based products and services include the monitoring of dangerous subsurface currents, iceberg detection and tracking, etc.
