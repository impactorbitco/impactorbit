description: >
  Earth observation contributes to vulnerability assessments for locations exposed to natural hazards. By integrating satellite imagery, remote sensing data, and historical environmental records, these applications enable the analysis of flood, drought, wildfire, and seismic risks. Climate projections and geospatial analytics support the evaluation of infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness, and adaptation planning, helping governments, urban planners, and emergency services mitigate potential impacts.
