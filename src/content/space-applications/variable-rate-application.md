markets: "Agriculture"
description: >
  Variable rate application leverages satellite and sensor data to apply inputs such as fertilizers, water, or pesticides at precise rates tailored to specific areas of a field. This optimises resource use, increases crop yield, and reduces environmental impact by minimizing over-application. It is a key technology in precision agriculture and sustainable farm management.
