title: "Marine pollution monitoring"
markets: "Environmental Monitoring"
description: >
  SAR-based and optical satellite data can be used for detecting and monitoring of oil spills and marine litter. Earth observation also provides forecasts of sea currents and sea-surface heights (altimetry), sea-surface salinity, sea-surface temperature, ocean colour and sea-ice data – useful for monitoring and forecasting the course of the pollution. Moreover, remote sensing data can also contribute to identifying the polluters. Ocean services Metocean (meteorology over oceans, and offshore weather and sea state monitoring): Earth observation can provide data for quality meteorology over oceans (offshore weather and sea state monitoring) complemented with near-real-time data collection of variables such as wave height and frequency, wind speed, direction, and ocean current velocity on global and regional scales.
