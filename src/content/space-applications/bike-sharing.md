description: >
  Bike-sharing and especially free-floating bike-sharing systems rely on GNSS to locate the bike across the city by both end users and the bike-sharing service provider. Public transport – buses: Public transit agencies use GNSS receivers in buses to track their location in real-time to display their position on a map in the control centre and their expected arrival times on digital displays at bus stops. Road fleet management: Fleet management on-board units transmit GNSS positioning information through telematics to support transport operators in monitoring the performance of logistics activities. This application is used within cars that form a so-called fleet such as taxis, rental cars and cars used for sharing schemes. Commercial vehicle fleet owners also adopt it. As subset, dangerous goods tracking is done by transmitting GNSS-based positioning data on the vehicles carrying them, together with other information about the status of the cargo.
