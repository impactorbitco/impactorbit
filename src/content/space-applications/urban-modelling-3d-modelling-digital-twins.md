description: >
  Earth observation data can serve as input to digital surface models, enabling simulations, including shadow effects or street canyon effects. The creation of so-called digital twins of cities would enable the visualization, monitoring and forecasting of natural and human activity in support of sustainable development. GNSS can help in precisely defining and measuring specific location points of interest for urban and 3D modelling purposes.
