  : Earth observation can provide a large variety of products and information supporting the identification of the most suitable areas for the exploitation of renewable energy sources. These products and information include for instance data on relevant environmental parameters influencing the production of energy, data on the status of the power plants, geological evaluation, topography mapping, etc. GNSS can enable geomatics applications such as mine and construction surveying, mapping and GIS, photogrammetry, laser scanning and remote sensing, as well as route planning and augmented reality visualization. The GNSS devices that are used for those applications include high-accuracy GNSS receivers (geodetic-grade smart antennas, all-in-one integrated mapping/GIS devices or infrastructure/CORS) and embedded chipsets. On the other hand, a number of CORS networks operate receivers that are powered by renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels or wind turbines), so the utilization of GNSS for renewable energy operations brings mutual benefits.
