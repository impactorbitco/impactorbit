description: >
  Earth observation can support mapping of urban land-use and land cover while enabling to classify built structures including building height and urban infrastructure such as roads. GNSS-based cadastral surveying and mapping help in precisely defining and measuring specific location points of interest for cartographic and urban planning purposes (all GNSS cadastral and mapping devices are being quantified under this application, regardless of where they are used e.g., non-urban areas, energy and raw materials, infrastructures). Both Earth observation and GNSS power GIS applications for surveying and mapping of urban areas.
