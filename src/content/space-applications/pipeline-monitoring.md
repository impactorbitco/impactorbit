title: "Pipeline monitoring"
markets: "Infrastructure"
description: >
  Earth observation can contribute to the monitoring of pipelines through the provision of ground deformation information across pipeline networks as well as through the provision of information related to vegetation encroachment or third-party interference. For above-ground pipelines, GNSS provides methods for stability monitoring like post-construction operations, while for underground assets it may feed high-accuracy positioning data into ground-penetration radars to map and detect leakages and other faults.
