description: >
  Earth observation can contribute to the selection of sites (e.g., tailing dams) or routes (e.g., roads/rail) through the provision of products and services such as geological evaluation, topography mapping, historical data on land subsidence. Through geomatics applications like construction surveying, mapping and GIS, photogrammetry, laser scanning and remote sensing, GNSS can significantly speed up the accurate determination of site borders, while also providing adequate methods for development of detailed specialized maps, route planning or establishment of GIS database with accurate positions of all infrastructure site features. In addition, to high-accuracy GNSS devices (smart antennas or integrated mapping/GIS devices), GNSS chipsets can feed high-accuracy positioning data into LiDAR and imaging devices (drone or land-based), and augmented reality technologies for a-priori in situ infrastructure visualization.
