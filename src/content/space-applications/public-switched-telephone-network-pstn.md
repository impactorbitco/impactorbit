markets: "Infrastructure"
description: >
  Telecom operators require accurate and consistent time and frequency at distant points of their networks to meet increasingly demanding broadband requirements. Originally a network of fixed-line analogue telephone systems, the PSTN is now entirely digital in its core network and in this report, it consists in fixed telephones networks. GNSS is usually a backup to atomic clocks to provide time slot management.
