### Overview
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) leverages satellite and remote sensing data to improve preparedness, early warning systems, and response strategies. By analyzing environmental and atmospheric conditions, DRM helps mitigate the impacts of natural and human-made disasters on communities and critical infrastructure.

### Key Applications
- **Early Warning Systems:** Predicting floods, hurricanes, and wildfires.
- **Post-Disaster Assessment:** Damage evaluation using high-resolution satellite imagery.
- **Infrastructure Protection:** Monitoring vulnerable infrastructure for risk mitigation.
- **Climate Resilience Planning:** Informing policy and urban planning to reduce future risks.

### Benefits
- Saves lives and reduces property damage.
- Supports data-driven disaster response.
- Enables efficient resource allocation during emergencies.
- Contributes to global disaster risk reduction initiatives.
