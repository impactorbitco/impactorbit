### Overview
Space Resource Utilisation enables the extraction and use of materials from asteroids, the Moon, and other celestial bodies. These resources can support in-orbit fuel production, construction of space infrastructure, and scientific research, reducing dependence on Earth-supplied materials.

### Key Applications
- **Asteroid Mining:** Extract metals and rare elements for industrial use.
- **Water Extraction:** Provide water for life support and fuel production in space.
- **In-Orbit Manufacturing:** Use locally sourced materials for building satellites and structures.
- **Sustainable Space Operations:** Reduce the need for repeated Earth launches by using local resources.

### Benefits
- Supports long-term sustainability of space operations.
- Reduces costs and environmental impact of transporting materials from Earth.
- Enables advanced in-space manufacturing and infrastructure.
- Fosters international collaboration and economic opportunities in space.
