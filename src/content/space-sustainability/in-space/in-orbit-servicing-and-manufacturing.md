### Overview
In-orbit servicing and manufacturing allows satellites and spacecraft to be repaired, refueled, upgraded, or assembled while in orbit. This reduces the need for replacement launches, mitigates space debris, and opens possibilities for large-scale in-space construction.

### Key Applications
- **Satellite Refueling & Repair:** Extends operational life and reduces replacement costs.
- **On-Orbit Manufacturing:** Produces components and structures directly in space.
- **Debris Mitigation:** Active servicing removes or repurposes defunct satellites.
- **Space Infrastructure Development:** Builds modular satellites and orbital stations efficiently.

### Benefits
- Reduces long-term space debris risk.
- Supports sustainable satellite operations.
- Enables advanced capabilities for future deep space missions.
- Lowers environmental and financial costs of satellite replacement.
