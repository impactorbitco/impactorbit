### Overview
The Space Environment includes all conditions and hazards in near-Earth orbit that can impact satellites and spacecraft, such as solar radiation, geomagnetic storms, orbital debris, and micrometeoroids. Monitoring these factors is crucial for mission planning, satellite longevity, and sustainable space operations.

### Key Applications
- **Space Weather Monitoring:** Tracking solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and radiation events.
- **Orbital Debris Tracking:** Monitoring space debris to prevent collisions.
- **Satellite Protection:** Designing satellites to withstand radiation and environmental hazards.
- **Mission Planning:** Safe deployment and orbital management for new satellites.

### Benefits
- Reduces risk of satellite damage or mission failure.
- Supports sustainable management of orbital space.
- Informs design and operational decisions for spacecraft.
- Enhances global collaboration in space safety and sustainability.
