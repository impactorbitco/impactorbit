how: "We support SDG18 by actively advocating for international policies that promote the responsible and sustainable development of space communities. Our efforts include engaging key stakeholders, facilitating research on the socio-environmental implications of space colonization, and raising global awareness about the necessity of extending sustainable development beyond Earth. Additionally, we collaborate with global space organizations to ensure exploration and expansion efforts align with ethical and sustainability principles."
