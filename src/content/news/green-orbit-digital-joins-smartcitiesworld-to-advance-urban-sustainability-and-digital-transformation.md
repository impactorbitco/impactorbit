Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its membership with SmartCitiesWorld, the global knowledge-sharing platform dedicated to solving urban challenges through innovation, collaboration, and sustainable technology. 

Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its membership with SmartCitiesWorld, the global knowledge-sharing platform dedicated to solving urban challenges through innovation, collaboration, and sustainable technology. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to shaping resilient, inclusive, and climate-conscious urban environments as the world’s cities confront rapid growth, environmental pressures, and shifting social needs.

The term ‘Smart City’ has become increasingly prominent—especially in the post-pandemic era—as societies push for greener, more efficient, and digitally connected urban living. But what exactly makes a city ‘smart’? Smart cities are grounded in a framework of information and communication technologies (ICT), enabling sustainable practices and smarter resource management to meet the mounting challenges of urbanisation.

“By 2050, an estimated 70% of the global population will reside in cities. This mass migration underscores the urgency of building cities that are not only livable and efficient but also environmentally responsible,” said Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “We’re thrilled to join the SmartCitiesWorld community to help amplify these crucial efforts through sustainable marketing, digital innovation, and space-enabled solutions.”


Smart cities operate on the premise of maximising available resources and improving services, quality of life, and infrastructure through data-driven technologies. Whether through public transport, water systems, energy management, or digital access to services, the overarching goals remain consistent: reduce waste, enhance performance, empower citizens, and create healthier urban ecosystems.

SmartCitiesWorld, with over 52,000 global members representing more than 3,000 cities, offers a collaborative platform that addresses these themes through five key content pillars:

- Connectivity & Data

- Governance & Citizen

- Energy & Environment

- Mobility

- Urban Space

As part of the collaboration, Green Orbit Digital will contribute thought leadership articles, co-develop city profiles, and spotlight innovations at the intersection of sustainability, marketing, and digital transformation. Their expertise in leveraging space-based insights—such as satellite data for environmental monitoring—aligns with SmartCitiesWorld’s mission to foster smarter, net-zero cities.

Examples of smart initiatives around the globe abound. In Dubai, the world’s longest driverless metro enhances sustainable mobility. Seoul’s government plans to roll out 270,000 electric vehicles by 2050. In Europe, cities like Edinburgh commit to localised food systems to tackle the climate emergency, while others embrace the 15-minute city model, championed by C40 and Arup, to build low-carbon, community-oriented neighbourhoods.

Artificial intelligence and IoT sensors are also transforming urban systems—from detecting traffic patterns to optimising energy grids and improving air quality. As cities generate oceans of data, the ability to extract value and engage citizens in the process is becoming a defining feature of truly smart urban planning.

Green Orbit Digital’s participation in SmartCitiesWorld underscores its growing role in supporting city leaders, public institutions, and businesses with sustainable strategy, stakeholder engagement, and climate communications. Their approach helps clients navigate complex transitions, unlock innovation ecosystems, and tell compelling stories of change.

In the words of a SmartCitiesWorld open letter: “At COP26, while nations pledge, it will be cities that must deliver.”
