Green Orbit Digital has joined the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum to advocate for the use of space technology in sustainability reporting. This initiative focuses on enhancing nature-related financial disclosures through the integration of space-based data, helping organisations track and manage their environmental impact more effectively.

## The Role of Space Technology in Sustainability Reporting

Space technology plays a pivotal role in sustainability reporting by providing high-quality, real-time environmental data. From satellite imagery to Earth observation systems, space technology enables organisations to monitor biodiversity, deforestation, carbon emissions, and water usage on a global scale.

Space-derived data helps businesses assess their environmental risks and opportunities. By using this data in sustainability reporting, organisations can create more transparent and actionable financial disclosures, ensuring better-informed decisions that align with global sustainability goals.

“Our membership in the TNFD Forum strengthens Green Orbit Digital’s commitment to incorporating space technology into sustainability practices,” said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.


## Promoting Stakeholder Engagement Through Space Technology

The integration of space technology into sustainability reporting also enhances stakeholder engagement. By using satellite data, businesses, financial institutions, and environmental organisations can collaborate more effectively, sharing insights and strategies to address nature-related financial risks. Green Orbit Digital is actively working to promote this collaboration within the TNFD Forum, advocating for the wider adoption of space technology in reporting frameworks.

## The Power of Space Data in Enhancing Financial Disclosures

The potential of space technology to improve the accuracy of financial disclosures is immense. With tools like Earth observation satellites, organisations can gain real-time insights into environmental changes and risks, providing a clearer picture of their impact on natural systems.

By incorporating space-based data into the TNFD’s recommended framework, Green Orbit Digital is helping to make nature-related financial disclosures more robust, credible, and actionable. This enhances stakeholder trust and helps businesses make informed, sustainable decisions. Learn more about the TNFD Framework.
