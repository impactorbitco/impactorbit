**Green Orbit Digital**, a Leicester-based sustainable marketing agency specialising in the space sector, has formally joined the **Culture Declares Emergency** movement, uniting with hundreds of arts, culture, and creative organisations worldwide in recognising and responding to the climate and ecological crisis.

# Our declaration

We declare that the Earth’s life-supporting systems are in collapse, threatening biodiversity and human societies everywhere.

Alive to the beauty of our planet, we unite to challenge the dominant global power structures that fail to protect us as they disregard scientific consensus, silence marginalised voices, and perpetuate ecocide.

As Declarers, we take action to harness the power of arts and culture to express heartfelt truths and address deep-rooted injustices, to care for and create adaptive, resilient and joyful communities, and to influence the urgent and necessary transformation of harmful global systems.

# Why we are declaring

The science is unequivocal: there is only a **5% chance** of limiting global average temperature rise to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement – based on a diluted IPCC assessment – is failing to deliver the systemic changes required to avert catastrophic climate disruption. Even the most ambitious national commitments remain inadequate.

The signs of breakdown are everywhere:  
- **Ecological emergency** – Three species are lost every hour. Insect populations are collapsing, threatening food security. Forests, coral reefs, mangroves, and biodiversity in plants, animals, and crops are in steep decline.  
- **Climate emergency** – Extreme heat, destructive storms, severe droughts, and devastating floods are accelerating. Sea levels are rising, and the Thwaites "Doomsday" Glacier may collapse within years, threatening coastal cities globally.  
- **Justice crisis** – The poorest 58% of the world’s population produce just 14.5% of global CO₂ emissions yet bear the brunt of the crisis, compounding inequalities and historic injustices.

# Our commitment

By declaring, Green Orbit Digital reaffirms its mission to harness **data-driven marketing, storytelling, and space-enabled technologies** to address these urgent challenges. We believe the space industry can play a pivotal role in monitoring environmental change, supporting disaster response, and building adaptive, resilient societies.

> “The space sector offers powerful tools to protect Earth’s life-support systems,” said **Ryan Laird**, Director and Founder of Green Orbit Digital. “Through creative campaigns and strategic partnerships, we will champion innovations, policies, and collaborations that help communities adapt, thrive, and safeguard biodiversity.”

Our declaration aligns with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** and our long-standing advocacy for sustainable business practices.  

As part of our commitment, we will:  
- Embed environmental responsibility into all client strategies and internal operations  
- Amplify climate-positive space sector innovations through targeted campaigns  
- Support cross-sector collaboration between creative, scientific, and policy communities  
- Share resources and insights to inspire other businesses to declare and act
