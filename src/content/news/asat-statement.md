We are thrilled to announce that Green Orbit Digital has officially become a signatory to The Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments to Not Conduct Destructive Anti-Satellite Testing. This statement, championed by the Secure World Foundation, underscores the critical importance of preventing destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite (DA-ASAT) missile testing to ensure the safety and sustainability of space activities. 

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the growing societal reliance on space applications and services, which are increasingly provided through commercial capabilities and products. As a responsible member of the global space industry, we are committed to upholding international commitments to safeguarding space assets and mitigating the risks associated with space debris. By endorsing this statement, Green Orbit Digital joins a diverse coalition of industry leaders, including operators of space systems, providers of space-based services, and users of space-derived services. Together, we emphasise the detrimental impact of destructive ASAT tests on the safety of space systems and the long-term sustainability of the space environment. 

The resolution passed by the UN General Assembly in December 2022, coupled with the commitments outlined in the Space Industry Statement, serves as a foundation for promoting responsible behaviour in space activities. By encouraging additional countries to make similar declarations, signatories aim to establish widely-accepted international norms that prioritise the prevention of deliberate destruction of space objects. 

Our decision to sign on to this statement reflects Green Orbit Digital’s dedication to ethical and sustainable business practices. It aligns with our core values of environmental stewardship and responsible innovation. By joining forces with other industry leaders, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing the responsible use of space for the benefit of present and future generations. We are proud to stand alongside the Secure World Foundation and our fellow signatories in this collective effort to foster a safe and sustainable space environment. Together, we demonstrate the power of collaboration and shared responsibility in shaping the future of space exploration and utilisation.
