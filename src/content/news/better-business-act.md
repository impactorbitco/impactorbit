exerpt: "As we stand at the precipice of change this Better Business Day 2024, the traditional paradigm of ‘business as usual’ is no longer sustainable. The Better Business Act aims to realign the interests of companies with those of society and the environment, allowing directors to prioritize social and environmental impacts over shareholder interests. With over 600 organisations already supporting this movement, the Better Business Act represents a shift towards stakeholder capitalism, emphasizing that businesses should serve employees, customers, communities, and the environment, not just shareholders."
