Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce that we have joined the Rainforest Foundation UK (RFUK) community, uniting with a global network of changemakers to protect rainforests, uphold indigenous rights, and drive climate resilience.

As a sustainable marketing agency dedicated to leveraging innovation and space technologies for environmental and social impact, Green Orbit Digital is aligned with RFUK’s mission to support forest communities in securing their land rights, protecting their environment, and shaping fair and inclusive solutions to climate change.

Since 1989, RFUK has helped indigenous peoples and local communities across the tropics protect over 84 million hectares of rainforest—an area larger than Scandinavia. By working through long-term partnerships and championing local control, RFUK’s values of self-determination, transparency, and environmental respect echo deeply with our own.

“Joining RFUK’s community is not only an honour, it’s a call to action. We believe that authentic climate leadership begins by amplifying frontline voices and shifting power to the people most affected by deforestation,” said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital. “Through this partnership, we aim to support RFUK’s pioneering efforts—from MappingForRights to advocating for policy reform—and bring new audiences into the conversation around rainforest protection and indigenous justice.”

Green Orbit Digital will support awareness-raising initiatives, engage our network in RFUK’s campaigns, and highlight the critical role of community-led conservation in achieving global climate goals.
