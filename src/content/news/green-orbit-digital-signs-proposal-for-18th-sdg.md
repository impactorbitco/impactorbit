Green Orbit Digital is proud to announce its endorsement of the proposal to introduce an 18th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) titled “Space for All, on Earth and Beyond.”

Proposed by leading organisations such as Space Renaissance International and the National Space Society, the 18th SDG initiative advocates for elevating space technology as critical elements of global sustainable development efforts.

“At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the immense potential of space technology in addressing humanity’s most pressing challenges and fostering universal prosperity,” said Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “By championing the proposal for an 18th SDG, we reaffirm our commitment to leveraging innovation, collaboration, and sustainability to shape a better future.”

The proposed 18th SDG seeks to harness the opportunities presented by space development to achieve the following outcomes:

1. Upgrading the 2030 Agenda: In light of the booming new space economy and major changes in global society, the addition of an 18th SDG reflects the evolving needs and opportunities of our interconnected world.

1. Enhancing Sustainability: By integrating space development into the SDGs, we can ensure the real sustainability of key pillars such as energy (SDG 7), economic growth (SDG 8), and industry innovation (SDG 9), without compromising environmental and social goals.

1. Attracting Investments: The proposal for a space-focused SDG is poised to attract significant investments in space exploration and infrastructure, driving economic growth and innovation on a global scale.

1. Fostering Public Awareness: By raising awareness of the vital role of civilian space development in sustainable development, the 18th SDG proposal aims to cultivate a better understanding and appreciation of space exploration among the general public.

1. Revitalising International Cooperation: The introduction of a space-focused SDG has the potential to revitalise institutions such as the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), positioning them as leaders in shaping global space policy and governance.

In endorsing the proposal for an 18th SDG, Green Orbit Digital reaffirms our commitment to advancing sustainability, innovation, and global collaboration. By embracing the opportunities presented by space exploration, we can chart a course towards a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for all.
