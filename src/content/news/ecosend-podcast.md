Green Orbit Digital is thrilled to announce our recent appearance on The Ecosend Podcast by GoSquared. In this exciting episode, our director, Ryan Laird, delved into the fascinating intersection of sustainability, space technology, and satellite management.

During the conversation with James on The Ecosend Podcast, Ryan shared insights into the rise of private ventures in the space industry and the challenges of integrating sustainable practices into satellite management. We explore how satellite data can be harnessed to combat climate change and monitor environmental health, offering real-time solutions for a planet in need.

At Green Orbit Digital, sustainability isn’t just a buzzword—it’s our guiding principle. Through our use of the Ecosend emailing platform, we’re proud to support renewable energy and reforestation projects while sharing our climate credentials with the EcoSend badge. Our appearance on The Ecosend Podcast reinforces our commitment to driving positive change through innovation and collaboration.

Tune in to The Ecosend Podcast to hear Ryan’s insights into the future of sustainability and space technology.
