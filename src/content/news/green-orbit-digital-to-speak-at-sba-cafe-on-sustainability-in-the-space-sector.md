Green Orbit Digital is pleased to announce that its Director, Ryan Laird, will be speaking at the Sustainable Business Alliance (SBA) Café on 17th March at 12:00 GMT. The session, titled “Sustainability in the Space Sector”, will explore the critical role of space technologies in addressing global sustainability challenges while ensuring the long-term viability of space itself.

As industries worldwide face increasing pressure to meet sustainability targets, the space sector is emerging as both a driver of environmental solutions and a domain requiring urgent action to mitigate risks such as space debris, orbital congestion, and emissions from launches. Green Orbit Digital is committed to advancing the conversation around space sustainability—a key area where innovation, policy, and responsible practices must align.

“Our ability to harness space technology for climate monitoring, disaster response, and environmental protection is more important than ever,” said Ryan Laird. “However, we must also ensure that space itself remains sustainable for future generations. This talk will highlight the balance we need to strike between leveraging space for good and preserving its long-term usability.”

The Sustainable Business Alliance (SBA), founded in 2023, works with academic and consultancy partners to help organisations integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles into their business strategies. Through its Sustainable Business Roadmap, SBA provides training, support, and tools for businesses navigating the complexities of sustainability, including regulatory requirements, investor expectations, and industry best practices.

The SBA Café is a monthly gathering of sustainability-focused professionals, offering opportunities for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and thought leadership on key topics. This upcoming session will highlight:

- How space technologies contribute to sustainability on Earth

- The challenges of managing space debris and orbital congestion

- Strategies for reducing the environmental impact of space activities

- The role of policy and innovation in ensuring space remains a sustainable resource

Green Orbit Digital is proud to support businesses and organisations in leveraging space technologies for sustainability. The company provides innovative marketing and strategic solutions to foster responsible growth within the space industry and beyond.
