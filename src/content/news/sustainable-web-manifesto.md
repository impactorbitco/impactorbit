Green Orbit Digital is thrilled to announce our dedication to sustainability by endorsing the Sustainable Web Manifesto. This manifesto, a public declaration of our shared commitment to creating a sustainable internet, underscores the vital importance of reducing the environmental impact of digital activities.

In today’s digital-centric world, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant carbon footprint associated with online operations.

“If the Internet were a nation, it would rank as the world’s fourth-largest polluter” 
 Study by Freitag et al. 2021.

This underscores the urgent need for sustainable practices in the digital sphere.

We all share and utilise the web, much like we all inhabit and rely on this planet,” remarked Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital.“By endorsing the Sustainable Web Manifesto, we’re publicly committing to prioritising sustainability in our digital endeavours and contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.”

The Sustainable Web Manifesto outlines five key principles that signatories pledge to uphold:

1. Clean: Green Orbit Digital will power its services with renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions associated with data centres and other digital infrastructure.

1. Efficient: We will strive to minimise energy and material resources used in the products and services we provide, ensuring maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact.

1. Open: We are committed to promoting accessibility, the open exchange of information, and user control over data in all our products and services.

1. Honest: We will uphold honesty and transparency in our design and content, ensuring that our products and services do not mislead or exploit users.

1. Regenerative: We will support an economy that nurtures both people and the planet, promoting sustainability and environmental stewardship in all aspects of our business operations.

1. Resilient: The products and services we provide will function in the times and places where people need them most, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in all conditions.
