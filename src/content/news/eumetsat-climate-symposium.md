name: 'Co-Creation in Action: Reflections from the 2025 EUMETSAT Climate Symposium'
excerpt: "In late October, Green Orbit Digital participated in the EUMETSAT Climate Symposium 2025, celebrating 25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT. The event emphasized the theme `From Space to Climate Service: Co-creation in Action,' highlighting the integration of satellite-derived climate information into decision-making. Key discussions focused on aligning satellite data with climate policies, enhancing collaboration among research institutions and industry, and utilizing emerging technologies like AI to improve data accessibility. Break-out sessions allowed participants to tackle real-world challenges, reinforcing the importance of user engagement in co-designing data products. The symposium underscored that effective communication and collaboration are essential for transforming climate data into meaningful action for society."

In late October, Green Orbit Digital joined delegates from across Europe’s climate and space communities in Darmstadt for the **EUMETSAT Climate Symposium 2025**, held under the theme *“From Space to Climate Service: Co-creation in Action.”*

The event marked **25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT**—a milestone in Europe’s commitment to operational climate monitoring and the use of satellite data to inform policy, drive innovation, and ultimately serve society. Over three days, scientists, policymakers, data providers, and technology leaders came together to explore how satellite-derived climate information can be more effectively integrated into decision-making and service design.


### **Bridging the Gap Between Space Data and Climate Action**

The symposium’s focus on *co-creation* resonated strongly with us at **Green Orbit Digital**. Our work often sits at the intersection of **space, sustainability, and communication**, helping organisations translate complex climate and environmental data into narratives that inform, inspire, and mobilise action.

Across sessions, a recurring theme was the importance of connecting the technical capabilities of Europe’s Earth observation infrastructure with the societal needs it serves. Whether through the **Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)**, the **EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facilities (SAFs)**, or national climate centres, the challenge is no longer just about generating data—it’s about making it meaningful.

Key discussions throughout the symposium explored how to:

- Align satellite-based data with evolving **climate policy frameworks** in Europe and globally.
- Strengthen collaboration between **research institutions, operational services, and industry**.
- Harness emerging technologies such as **AI, machine learning, and cloud computing** to improve data accessibility.
- Quantify and communicate the **socio-economic value** of climate information to decision-makers and the public.

These themes directly mirror the work we champion at Green Orbit Digital—helping partners in the space and sustainability sectors design **data-driven narratives** that build trust, demonstrate impact, and accelerate the uptake of environmental innovation.


### **Co-Creation in Practice: The Break-Out Sessions**

One of the most dynamic aspects of the symposium was the series of **Break-Out Sessions** on 29 October, where participants collaborated on practical approaches to real-world challenges. Each session was led by an operational or research institution, creating space for open dialogue between scientists, service providers, and users.

Topics ranged from **solar energy forecasting** and **drought monitoring** to **marine applications**, **hydrological modelling**, and **heat management** in urban areas. Others addressed how to better **bridge data and demand**, ensuring that climate services meet the needs of different user groups—from policymakers to local planners and businesses.

A recurring insight across the discussions was that **user engagement must happen from the very beginning**. Data products alone are not enough; their value emerges when they are co-designed with those who depend on them. That idea—turning data into dialogue—is central to how we approach sustainability communication at Green Orbit Digital.


### **Exploring the Fair of Opportunities**

Running throughout the symposium was the **Fair of Opportunities**, an open exhibition showcasing Europe’s rich ecosystem of climate data services. Organised into thematic “islands”, it brought together contributors from across the **EUMETSAT SAF network**, the **Copernicus services**, and leading research institutions.

Exhibitors demonstrated how satellite-based data supports applications in **solar energy, drought management, marine and heat monitoring, and global climate observation**—each essential to Europe’s path toward climate resilience.

For us, the Fair was a tangible reminder that the communication of these capabilities is as vital as the technologies themselves. In many ways, the most powerful form of innovation happens not only in laboratories and control rooms, but in how these advancements are **shared, contextualised, and understood** by those shaping the future of our planet.


### **From Data to Dialogue**

Throughout the symposium, one message was clear: the future of climate services depends on collaboration—not only between research and operations, but also across sectors and disciplines. The integration of AI and cloud computing will open new possibilities for processing and visualising satellite data, but technology alone won’t drive impact. That comes from **co-creation**, **accessibility**, and **effective storytelling**.

At Green Orbit Digital, this aligns directly with our mission. We work with organisations across the space and environmental sectors to make **complex climate intelligence accessible**, designing communication strategies and digital platforms that help translate data into understanding and understanding into action.

The conversations in Darmstadt reaffirmed the value of this work. As EUMETSAT and its partners look toward the next generation of Earth observation systems, it is clear that data literacy, design thinking, and strategic communication will play a pivotal role in ensuring these systems deliver their full societal benefit.


### **Looking Forward**

The symposium closed with a celebration of **25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT**—a testament to Europe’s sustained commitment to using space-based observation for the common good. It also served as a forward-looking reflection on how the next 25 years will require even greater integration between science, technology, and communication.

For Green Orbit Digital, participation in this milestone event was both an opportunity to engage with the European climate data community and a reminder of the responsibility we share—to ensure that the insights captured from space are translated into impact on Earth.

The conversations sparked in Darmstadt will continue to inform how we approach our work: using digital storytelling, sustainable marketing, and data strategy to help bridge the gap between **observation and action**—from orbit to outcome.
