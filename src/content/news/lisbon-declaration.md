Green Orbit Digital proudly participated in the Management and Sustainability of Outer Space Activities Conference, held on 14-15 May 2024, in Lisbon. This event, co-organised by the Portuguese Space Agency and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), gathered a diverse array of stakeholders, including Member States, civil and youth organisations, industry leaders, and academic experts, to address the pressing issues of outer space sustainability and governance. Our engagement in the conference underscored the pivotal role of marketing and communications in fostering a multi-stakeholder dialogue.

Effective communication strategies are essential to ensure that all parties involved understand the impact of space activities and are aligned in their efforts towards sustainable development. By prioritising transparency and authenticity, Green Orbit Digital contributes to avoiding greenwashing—a practice that can undermine trust and progress. 

The Lisbon Declaration on Outer Space, emerging from this conference, highlighted several key themes that resonate with our values and mission at Green Orbit Digital: 

1. Inclusive and Sustainable Space Governance: The declaration emphasised the need for comprehensive international cooperation and consensus through platforms such as the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). This collaborative approach aims to develop voluntary principles and guidelines addressing space debris, traffic management, and resource utilisation. 

1. Multi-Sector Participation: Recognising the importance of multi-stakeholder engagement, the declaration advocates for meaningful participation from all sectors in the development of space governance norms. This inclusive approach ensures that policies are well-rounded and consider diverse perspectives, including those from the private sector, academia, and civil society. 

1. Transparency and Clarity: The need for clear and consistent policies across international forums was a critical takeaway. By fostering transparency, stakeholders can better navigate the complexities of space activities, ensuring safety and sustainability are maintained. 

1. Youth Engagement: The declaration highlighted the significance of youth participation in space activities. By involving younger generations in decision-making processes, we ensure that the future of space exploration and utilisation remains sustainable and peaceful. 

1. Future Initiatives: The Summit of the Future and the Pact for the Future were identified as key initiatives to enhance cooperation in outer space governance. These efforts, led by UNOOSA, aim to build capacity, particularly for developing space nations, ensuring that space benefits are globally shared. 

Green Orbit Digital is committed to leveraging our expertise in marketing and communications to support these initiatives. We believe that clear, authentic communication is fundamental to achieving sustainable outcomes in space activities. By promoting a common language around “sustainability” and steering clear of greenwashing, we can build trust and drive meaningful progress. 

Our role extends beyond participation; it involves actively contributing to the dialogue and implementation of the Lisbon Declaration’s principles. We aim to bridge the gap between technical experts and the broader public, ensuring that the importance of sustainable space activities is widely understood and supported. 

The Management and Sustainability of Outer Space Activities Conference has set a strong foundation for future cooperation and action. Green Orbit Digital looks forward to continuing our involvement in this vital global conversation, promoting sustainable and transparent practices in the exploration and use of outer space.
