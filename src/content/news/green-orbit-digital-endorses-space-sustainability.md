Green Orbit Digital is proud endorse the Space Safety Coalition’s (SSC) Best Practices for the Sustainability of Space Operations. Joining a network of 45 global leaders, we are committed to advancing space sustainability, mitigating the risks of orbital debris, and ensuring long-term safety for space operations. This underscores Green Orbit Digital’s support innovative and responsible solutions to the growing challenges of space sustainability.

## Why Space Sustainability Is Critical

Space is vital to modern society, supporting global communications, navigation, climate monitoring, and disaster management. However, the orbital environment faces significant risks. The European Space Agency (ESA) estimates over 40,500 large debris objects, 1.1 million fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm, and 130 million smaller fragments currently orbit Earth.

These fragments, traveling at speeds of 28,000 km/h, pose severe risks to satellites, space missions, and even the International Space Station (ISS). A collision with even a small fragment could result in catastrophic damage. Without proactive measures, the orbital environment may become increasingly congested and hazardous, impacting both current operations and future exploration.

Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of SSC’s Version 2.39 Best Practices aligns with the urgent need to tackle these challenges and support the sustainable growth of the space industry.

## SSC’s Best Practices: A Framework for Sustainable Space

The SSC’s Best Practices are designed to address the complexities of orbital sustainability through clear, actionable guidelines. These principles, aligned with international standards such as the UN COPUOS Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines and ISO 24113, promote responsible operations and collaboration across the space sector.

### Core Principles

1. Preventing Orbital Debris: Encouraging responsible satellite design and mission planning to minimise waste.

1. Post-Mission Disposal: Supporting the timely deorbiting of spacecraft and spent stages.

1. Enhancing Data Sharing: Improving space situational awareness (SSA) by fostering open communication among operators.

1. Sustainable Design: Promoting technologies that enable efficient tracking, collision avoidance, and end-of-life disposal.

1. Eco-Friendly Launch Practices: Advocating for reusable rockets and green propellants to reduce the environmental footprint of launches.

These guidelines provide a foundation for creating a safer and more sustainable orbital environment.

## Tackling Orbital Debris: Innovative Solutions

Innovative technologies are emerging to address the pressing issue of orbital debris:

- Active Debris Removal (ADR): Companies like Astroscale are pioneering ADR missions, including ELSA-d, which aims to capture and remove non-functional satellites from orbit.

- Passive Deorbit Technologies: Drag sails developed by companies like Vestigo Aerospace accelerate satellite re-entry at the end of their operational lifecycle.

- Advanced Tracking Systems: Organisations such as LeoLabs provide radar-based solutions to monitor and predict debris movements, enabling safer navigation and collision avoidance.

While these technologies show great promise, challenges such as high costs, scalability, and the need for international cooperation must be addressed to implement them effectively.

## The Economic Imperative of Space Sustainability

Space sustainability is not just an environmental concern; it is an economic necessity. Operators now spend millions annually on collision avoidance manoeuvres, which consume valuable satellite resources and shorten mission lifespans. Rising insurance premiums further reflect the growing risks posed by space debris.

If left unaddressed, the economic burden of space debris could exceed billions of dollars annually, as projected by the Secure World Foundation. Proactive investment in sustainability today will prevent greater costs in the future, preserving the financial viability of space operations.

## Governance and Collaboration: A Unified Approach

Voluntary guidelines like the SSC’s Best Practices provide a strong foundation, but binding international regulations are essential for long-term sustainability. Bodies like the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) must work towards:

- Establishing mandatory compliance with debris mitigation standards like ISO 24113.

- Incentivising sustainable practices through grants, tax breaks, or priority access to orbital slots.

- Implementing penalties for non-compliance to deter irresponsible behaviour.

Collaboration between governments, commercial operators, and civil society will be key to addressing these governance challenges and ensuring equitable access to orbital resources.

## Green Orbit Digital: Empowering Space Sustainability

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise that space sustainability is not just about avoiding risk—it is an opportunity to drive innovation, build public trust, and ensure the long-term growth of the space economy. As a sustainability-driven marketing agency, we:

- Raise Awareness: Bridging the gap between technical experts and the public to amplify the importance of sustainable space operations.

- Support Collaboration: Empowering businesses to align with global sustainability goals through actionable strategies.

- Inspire Future Generations: Engaging young professionals to prioritise sustainability in their careers through education and outreach.

By integrating sustainability into our core operations, we aim to lead by example and inspire collective action across the industry.

## Join the Mission for a Sustainable Orbital Future

Green Orbit Digital invites spacefaring organisations to endorse the SSC’s Best Practices and contribute to safeguarding the orbital environment. By taking proactive steps now, we can ensure space remains a resource for innovation, exploration, and opportunity.
