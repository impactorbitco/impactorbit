Green Orbit Digital has recently completed the **Carbon Literacy and Net Zero Growth Programme**, delivered by the **University of Leicester School of Business**. The initiative brought together business leaders from across the region to explore how organisations can embed sustainability into their strategies, engage customers around climate action, and design credible pathways to Net Zero growth.

For us, the programme offered more than just an educational experience—it was an opportunity to reflect on how we can further integrate sustainability into every aspect of our work, from digital operations to client strategy.



### **Building Foundations for Sustainable Growth**

The programme provided a holistic framework for businesses seeking to move from awareness to measurable action. Through expert-led sessions and collaborative workshops, participants developed a deeper understanding of the science behind carbon literacy, the business case for sustainability, and the behavioural shifts required to deliver meaningful change.

At Green Orbit Digital, these insights reinforced the importance of **data-driven decision-making**—something we already champion in our marketing and communications work. Whether optimising website infrastructure for lower emissions, refining content strategies to highlight authentic sustainability action, or helping organisations communicate their environmental impact with confidence, the principles of carbon literacy align directly with our mission: to make sustainability both strategic and measurable.



### **Aligning Purpose with Practice**

The programme also challenged us to think critically about how we measure our own footprint and influence. As a digital agency working at the intersection of **space, technology, and sustainability**, we recognise that the environmental impact of digital activity—from data centres to campaign delivery—must be part of the wider conversation on Net Zero.

By embedding carbon literacy into our internal processes, we’re now able to more effectively:

- Assess and reduce the carbon footprint of our digital tools and platforms.
- Support clients in designing **low-impact, purpose-driven campaigns**.
- Integrate sustainability reporting and storytelling into their communication strategies.
- Offer enhanced **Sustainability Audits** that include both marketing performance and environmental indicators.

This approach not only improves operational efficiency but also strengthens the credibility and trust that brands need when communicating climate action to stakeholders.



### **Leading Through Communication**

A recurring theme throughout the programme was that climate leadership is as much about **communication** as it is about carbon reduction. The ability to translate complex environmental data into meaningful narratives can drive understanding, inspire collaboration, and influence behaviour at scale.

> “The programme reinforced that sustainability isn’t a bolt-on—it’s a mindset that shapes how we operate and how we help others grow,” said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.

> “For us, carbon literacy bridges the gap between digital strategy and environmental responsibility. It ensures that every campaign, platform, and partnership contributes to something bigger—a business ecosystem aligned with planetary health.”

### **A Shared Journey Toward Net Zero**

What stood out most was the sense of collaboration—businesses from diverse sectors coming together to learn, share, and co-create solutions. The University of Leicester’s expert facilitation and practical approach made sustainability tangible, equipping participants with the knowledge and confidence to act.

For Green Orbit Digital, completing the programme marks an evolution in how we define success: growth that balances innovation with integrity. As we continue supporting organisations across the **space, climate, and technology sectors**, these lessons will underpin our work—helping clients communicate impact authentically, make smarter data-led sustainability choices, and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Because in the end, achieving Net Zero isn’t just about targets or technology—it’s about the stories we tell, the actions we take, and the partnerships we build along the way.
