As advocates for sustainability and innovation, Green Orbit Digital is thrilled to announce our participation in the 6th edition of Space Resources Week. This multidisciplinary event serves as a convergence point for space agencies, industry leaders, scientists, and visionaries, fostering discussions on the utilisation of space resources for a cleaner future in space.

## Advancing Space Resource Utilisation 

This year’s theme, “Shaping global priorities and coordinating efforts to advance space resource utilisation towards cleaner space activities beyond exploration,” resonates deeply with our commitment to sustainability. The focus extends beyond mere exploration to actively shaping global priorities and fostering collaboration to harness space resources responsibly.

## Building a Sustainable Space Architecture

The objective is clear – to strengthen the foundational aspects of space resources, aligning scientific pursuits with commercial needs and capabilities. Green Orbit Digital recognises the significance of developing a sustainable space architecture that will lay the groundwork for future endeavours in space.

## Preliminary Programme 

The response to this year’s programme has been outstanding, with over 150 abstracts submitted. We are excited to view the preliminary programme, providing a glimpse into the diverse and groundbreaking topics that will be explored during the event. These include a panel discussion on “In-Situ Resource Utilization for the benefit of sustainable exploration” and a session on “Building a sustained international future for space resources”.

## Organisers and Collaborators 

Space Resources Week is organised by the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC), the Luxembourg Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). Green Orbit Digital is honoured to contribute to this collaborative effort, leveraging our expertise to add value to discussions surrounding sustainable space resource utilisation.

## Our Perspective 

As a company passionate about sustainability and technology, our involvement in this event aligns seamlessly with our values. We are particularly excited about addressing key issues such as minimising the environmental impact of space activities, fostering global cooperation, and exploring innovative solutions for sustainable cosmic exploration.

Space Resources Week represents a pivotal moment in advancing our understanding and utilisation of space resources. Green Orbit Digital is proud to be part of this transformative event, contributing insights and perspectives that align with our commitment to building a sustainable future – not just on Earth but also beyond our planet. 

Stay tuned for updates as we delve into the exciting discussions and discoveries that unfold during the event.
