transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability. With increasing commercial involvement in space and heightened international commitments to responsible space practices, the year saw a range of key developments aimed at ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of space operations.\n\n## 1. Addressing Space Debris and Traffic Management\n\nSpace debris and traffic management emerged as critical challenges in 2024. With the expected tripling of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next six years, the risk of collisions and the creation of more debris has raised serious concerns for the sustainability of space operations.\n\nIn response, the space industry has prioritised active debris removal and collision avoidance systems. Astroscale’s ADRAS-J mission made notable progress in space debris management, demonstrating the potential of rendezvous technology by approaching space debris. Though the mission was halted due to an anomaly, it marked a significant step forward for debris removal.\n\nThe Zero Debris Charter also gained traction, promoting active debris removal and satellite end-of-life management practices. Moreover, space traffic management was a central topic in 2024, with increased calls for the development of global Space Situational Awareness (SSA) systems. The need for international cooperation to track and monitor space objects is more pressing than ever to ensure the safety of satellites, human spaceflight platforms, and other space-based services.\n\n## 2. In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM)\n\nA key development in 2024 was the emergence of In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM) as a major industry focus. The IOSM 2024 Conference, held in Harwell, Oxfordshire, brought together experts from the global IOSM industry to discuss the current and future landscape of in-orbit servicing and manufacturing. The conference highlighted the economic, environmental, and scientific benefits of IOSM technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise satellite servicing, reduce space debris, and enhance the sustainability of space operations.\n\nWith over 50 expert speakers, including representatives from the UK and US space agencies, the event provided critical insights into the role of investment, education, training, sustainability, and regulation in the development of the IOSM industry. The discussions at IOSM 2024 emphasised the importance of innovation and collaboration to maximise the benefits of IOSM, supporting its future growth as a cornerstone of sustainable space infrastructure.\n\nThe success of the inaugural IOSM event in 2024 has set the stage for the UK’s second ISAM Conference in 2025, which will be held at the ICC Belfast. With a significantly expanded programme and increased interest, the 2025 event is expected to reflect the growing importance of IOSM for both UK and international space sectors.\n\n## 3. The Space Industry’s Role in Sustainability\n\n2024 also saw a notable shift in the space industry’s commitment to sustainability, driven by the increasing involvement of the private sector. The Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments Not to Conduct Destructive Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) Testing garnered strong support from space operators, satellite providers, and space-derived service users. As of October 2023, 37 countries, including all EU member states, pledged not to conduct destructive DA-ASAT missile tests, in line with the UN General Assembly’s resolution passed in December 2022.\n\nThis commitment, coupled with ongoing industry efforts to avoid the intentional creation of space debris and safely de-orbit satellites at the end of their operational life, exemplifies the commercial space sector’s growing responsibility in protecting the space environment. The space industry’s active role in space debris mitigation, collision avoidance, and end-of-life satellite management aligns with broader efforts to establish space as a sustainable, shared resource.\n\n## 4. Advancements in Sustainable Space Technologies\n\nThe push for sustainability in space also spurred technological innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of space operations. One of the most notable innovations of 2024 was LignoSat, the world’s first wood-panelled satellite, developed by Japanese researchers. Constructed from sustainable magnolia wood, LignoSat weighs just 900g and is a pioneering step towards using renewable materials in space exploration. Its success could pave the way for sustainable construction materials for future lunar and Martian habitats.\n\nMoreover, the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative continued to advance, with the goal of creating a digital twin of Earth by 2030. The integration of AI, supercomputing, and satellite data will enhance climate modelling, resource management, and disaster prediction, supporting global sustainability and climate action efforts.\n\n## 5. Global Collaboration for Space Sustainability\n\nInternational collaboration remained central to the space sector’s sustainability efforts in 2024. The ITU Space Sustainability Forum, held in Geneva, gathered over 2,000 participants, discussing key issues such as space debris, space traffic management, and the efficient use of orbital resources. The forum highlighted the need for global cooperation, particularly in developing common regulatory frameworks, sharing data on space traffic, and supporting capacity-building for new entrants in the space sector.\n\nThe forum also emphasised the importance of partnerships between space agencies, the private sector, and international organisations to address the pressing challenges of space sustainability. Discussions included the need for transparency, monitoring systems, and regulations to prevent the deliberate creation of long-lived debris, which poses a threat to future space operations.\n\n## 6. The Future of Lunar Exploration and Sustainability\n\nAs lunar exploration picks up pace, the need for sustainable practices extends beyond Earth’s orbit. With multiple nations planning missions to the Moon, discussions in 2024 increasingly focused on ensuring sustainability in lunar operations. This includes developing precise landing technologies and creating shared frameworks for information exchange to avoid interference on the lunar surface.\n\nSustainability on the Moon will require careful management of lunar resources, preventing contamination, and coordinating exploration efforts internationally. These discussions are crucial to ensuring that lunar exploration benefits all of humanity without compromising the space environment.\n\n## Looking Ahead: A Sustainable Future for Space\n\nThe developments in 2024 demonstrate a growing consensus within the space sector about the importance of sustainability. From advancements in in-orbit servicing, space debris management, and technological innovations to international agreements on responsible space practices, the space industry is making significant strides toward ensuring that space remains a sustainable resource.\n\nAs the space sector continues to expand, these efforts will be critical to ensuring the safe, peaceful, and responsible use of space. Through international collaboration, technological innovation, and industry leadership, the space community is poised to tackle the challenges of the coming decades, ensuring that space remains a shared and sustainable domain for future generations.&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/blog/2024-in-review.md&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;043583503e79ca39&quot;],&quot;rendered&quot;:[0,{&quot;html&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 marked a significant period of transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability.
