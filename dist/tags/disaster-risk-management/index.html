transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability. With increasing commercial involvement in space and heightened international commitments to responsible space practices, the year saw a range of key developments aimed at ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of space operations.\n\n## 1. Addressing Space Debris and Traffic Management\n\nSpace debris and traffic management emerged as critical challenges in 2024. With the expected tripling of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next six years, the risk of collisions and the creation of more debris has raised serious concerns for the sustainability of space operations.\n\nIn response, the space industry has prioritised active debris removal and collision avoidance systems. Astroscale’s ADRAS-J mission made notable progress in space debris management, demonstrating the potential of rendezvous technology by approaching space debris. Though the mission was halted due to an anomaly, it marked a significant step forward for debris removal.\n\nThe Zero Debris Charter also gained traction, promoting active debris removal and satellite end-of-life management practices. Moreover, space traffic management was a central topic in 2024, with increased calls for the development of global Space Situational Awareness (SSA) systems. The need for international cooperation to track and monitor space objects is more pressing than ever to ensure the safety of satellites, human spaceflight platforms, and other space-based services.\n\n## 2. In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM)\n\nA key development in 2024 was the emergence of In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM) as a major industry focus. The IOSM 2024 Conference, held in Harwell, Oxfordshire, brought together experts from the global IOSM industry to discuss the current and future landscape of in-orbit servicing and manufacturing. The conference highlighted the economic, environmental, and scientific benefits of IOSM technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise satellite servicing, reduce space debris, and enhance the sustainability of space operations.\n\nWith over 50 expert speakers, including representatives from the UK and US space agencies, the event provided critical insights into the role of investment, education, training, sustainability, and regulation in the development of the IOSM industry. The discussions at IOSM 2024 emphasised the importance of innovation and collaboration to maximise the benefits of IOSM, supporting its future growth as a cornerstone of sustainable space infrastructure.\n\nThe success of the inaugural IOSM event in 2024 has set the stage for the UK’s second ISAM Conference in 2025, which will be held at the ICC Belfast. With a significantly expanded programme and increased interest, the 2025 event is expected to reflect the growing importance of IOSM for both UK and international space sectors.\n\n## 3. The Space Industry’s Role in Sustainability\n\n2024 also saw a notable shift in the space industry’s commitment to sustainability, driven by the increasing involvement of the private sector. The Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments Not to Conduct Destructive Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) Testing garnered strong support from space operators, satellite providers, and space-derived service users. As of October 2023, 37 countries, including all EU member states, pledged not to conduct destructive DA-ASAT missile tests, in line with the UN General Assembly’s resolution passed in December 2022.\n\nThis commitment, coupled with ongoing industry efforts to avoid the intentional creation of space debris and safely de-orbit satellites at the end of their operational life, exemplifies the commercial space sector’s growing responsibility in protecting the space environment. The space industry’s active role in space debris mitigation, collision avoidance, and end-of-life satellite management aligns with broader efforts to establish space as a sustainable, shared resource.\n\n## 4. Advancements in Sustainable Space Technologies\n\nThe push for sustainability in space also spurred technological innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of space operations. One of the most notable innovations of 2024 was LignoSat, the world’s first wood-panelled satellite, developed by Japanese researchers. Constructed from sustainable magnolia wood, LignoSat weighs just 900g and is a pioneering step towards using renewable materials in space exploration. Its success could pave the way for sustainable construction materials for future lunar and Martian habitats.\n\nMoreover, the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative continued to advance, with the goal of creating a digital twin of Earth by 2030. The integration of AI, supercomputing, and satellite data will enhance climate modelling, resource management, and disaster prediction, supporting global sustainability and climate action efforts.\n\n## 5. Global Collaboration for Space Sustainability\n\nInternational collaboration remained central to the space sector’s sustainability efforts in 2024. The ITU Space Sustainability Forum, held in Geneva, gathered over 2,000 participants, discussing key issues such as space debris, space traffic management, and the efficient use of orbital resources. The forum highlighted the need for global cooperation, particularly in developing common regulatory frameworks, sharing data on space traffic, and supporting capacity-building for new entrants in the space sector.\n\nThe forum also emphasised the importance of partnerships between space agencies, the private sector, and international organisations to address the pressing challenges of space sustainability. Discussions included the need for transparency, monitoring systems, and regulations to prevent the deliberate creation of long-lived debris, which poses a threat to future space operations.\n\n## 6. The Future of Lunar Exploration and Sustainability\n\nAs lunar exploration picks up pace, the need for sustainable practices extends beyond Earth’s orbit. With multiple nations planning missions to the Moon, discussions in 2024 increasingly focused on ensuring sustainability in lunar operations. This includes developing precise landing technologies and creating shared frameworks for information exchange to avoid interference on the lunar surface.\n\nSustainability on the Moon will require careful management of lunar resources, preventing contamination, and coordinating exploration efforts internationally. These discussions are crucial to ensuring that lunar exploration benefits all of humanity without compromising the space environment.\n\n## Looking Ahead: A Sustainable Future for Space\n\nThe developments in 2024 demonstrate a growing consensus within the space sector about the importance of sustainability. From advancements in in-orbit servicing, space debris management, and technological innovations to international agreements on responsible space practices, the space industry is making significant strides toward ensuring that space remains a sustainable resource.\n\nAs the space sector continues to expand, these efforts will be critical to ensuring the safe, peaceful, and responsible use of space. Through international collaboration, technological innovation, and industry leadership, the space community is poised to tackle the challenges of the coming decades, ensuring that space remains a shared and sustainable domain for future generations.&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/blog/2024-in-review.md&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;043583503e79ca39&quot;],&quot;rendered&quot;:[0,{&quot;html&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 marked a significant period of transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability.

The European State of the Climate report for 2023, a collaborative effort by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), delivers crucial insights into Europe’s climate landscape, highlighting the urgent need for action and adaptation.\n\n## Satellites: Eyes on the Climate \n\nSatellites play a pivotal role in unraveling the complexities of climate change, offering a bird’s-eye view of our planet’s evolving dynamics. The Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, with its array of thematic services, including Atmosphere, Marine, Land, and Climate Change, harnesses space-based data to provide policymakers, scientists, and the public with timely and reliable information crucial for informed decision-making.\n\n## Key Findings: A Snapshot of Climate Realities \n\nThe report paints a stark picture of Europe’s climate in 2023, marked by extreme weather events and their profound repercussions:\n\n1. Rising Temperatures: 2023 ranked as one of the warmest years on record for Europe, with temperatures consistently above average throughout the year. The frequency of heatwaves, coupled with escalating heat-related mortality rates, underscores the urgent need for adaptive measures.\n\n1. Oceanic Anomalies: Europe witnessed unprecedented warmth in its oceans, with the average sea surface temperature reaching record highs. Marine heatwaves, such as the one observed off the coast of Ireland and the UK, underscore the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to climate-induced stressors.\n\n1. Hydrological Extremes: Increased precipitation led to heightened flood risks across Europe, with significant portions of the river network experiencing flows exceeding historical thresholds. The economic and societal toll of flooding underscores the imperative for resilient infrastructure and robust disaster preparedness.\n\n1. Renewable Energy Dynamics: Despite the climate challenges, 2023 saw a record proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources in Europe. Monitoring renewable energy potentials, including wind and solar, is crucial for steering the continent towards a sustainable energy future.\n\n1. Glacial Retreat: Glaciers in the European Alps witnessed alarming rates of ice loss, driven by diminished snowfall and prolonged summer melt. These trends not only threaten freshwater resources but also serve as poignant indicators of global warming’s far-reaching consequences. \n\n1. Bridging Science and Society Beyond the realm of data and statistics, the ESOTC report underscores the human dimension of climate change. Heatwaves, floods, and wildfires exact a toll on public health, livelihoods, and economies. Communicating the urgency of climate action and fostering resilience within communities are imperative for navigating the turbulent waters of a changing climate.\n\n## Communicating Impact: Amplifying the Urgency of Climate Action \n\nEffective communication lies at the heart of addressing the climate crisis. While scientific data and technical reports provide invaluable insights into climate trends, translating these findings into relatable narratives is essential for fostering public understanding, galvanising political will, and driving meaningful action. Here’s why communicating the impact of climate change is crucial:\n\n1. Humanising Climate Change: Behind every statistic lies a human story. Communicating the real-life experiences of individuals and communities affected by climate-related disasters humanises the issue, evoking empathy and solidarity. By amplifying personal narratives, we bridge the gap between abstract data and tangible realities, making the urgency of climate action resonate on a personal level.\n\n1. Raising Awareness: Many people remain unaware of the severity and immediacy of climate change. Effective communication campaigns, leveraging diverse mediums such as social media, documentaries, and grassroots outreach, are vital for raising awareness about the environmental, social, and economic implications of climate change. By disseminating accurate information in accessible formats, we empower individuals to make informed choices and advocate for change.\n\n1. Building Political Will: Political leaders play a pivotal role in driving climate action at local, national, and global levels. Communicating the urgency of climate change and its multifaceted impacts is essential for mobilising political will and catalysing policy reforms. By engaging policymakers, stakeholders, and the public in informed dialogue, we create an enabling environment for ambitious climate policies and investments in sustainable solutions.\n\n1. Fostering Resilience: Climate change disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities. Effective communication of climate risks and adaptation strategies is crucial for building resilience within communities, particularly those on the frontlines of climate impacts. By empowering communities with knowledge and resources, we enable them to prepare for, mitigate, and recover from climate-related disasters, fostering adaptive capacity and resilience.\n\n1. Inspiring Collective Action: Addressing the climate crisis requires collective action on a global scale. By communicating success stories, innovative solutions, and opportunities for meaningful engagement, we inspire individuals, businesses, and governments to take proactive steps towards sustainability. Whether through community-led initiatives, corporate sustainability pledges, or international agreements, effective communication serves as a catalyst for collective action and collaboration. In essence, communicating the impact of climate change is not merely about conveying information; it is about igniting empathy, fostering understanding, and inspiring action. By amplifying voices, sharing stories, and mobilising communities, we can collectively rise to the challenge of climate change, safeguarding our planet and ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nCredit: The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission: the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).\n\n## Empowering Climate Communication with Green Orbit Digital \n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we understand the critical importance of effective climate communication in driving meaningful action.
