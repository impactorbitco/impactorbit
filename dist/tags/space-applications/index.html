transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability. With increasing commercial involvement in space and heightened international commitments to responsible space practices, the year saw a range of key developments aimed at ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of space operations.\n\n## 1. Addressing Space Debris and Traffic Management\n\nSpace debris and traffic management emerged as critical challenges in 2024. With the expected tripling of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next six years, the risk of collisions and the creation of more debris has raised serious concerns for the sustainability of space operations.\n\nIn response, the space industry has prioritised active debris removal and collision avoidance systems. Astroscale’s ADRAS-J mission made notable progress in space debris management, demonstrating the potential of rendezvous technology by approaching space debris. Though the mission was halted due to an anomaly, it marked a significant step forward for debris removal.\n\nThe Zero Debris Charter also gained traction, promoting active debris removal and satellite end-of-life management practices. Moreover, space traffic management was a central topic in 2024, with increased calls for the development of global Space Situational Awareness (SSA) systems. The need for international cooperation to track and monitor space objects is more pressing than ever to ensure the safety of satellites, human spaceflight platforms, and other space-based services.\n\n## 2. In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM)\n\nA key development in 2024 was the emergence of In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM) as a major industry focus. The IOSM 2024 Conference, held in Harwell, Oxfordshire, brought together experts from the global IOSM industry to discuss the current and future landscape of in-orbit servicing and manufacturing. The conference highlighted the economic, environmental, and scientific benefits of IOSM technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise satellite servicing, reduce space debris, and enhance the sustainability of space operations.\n\nWith over 50 expert speakers, including representatives from the UK and US space agencies, the event provided critical insights into the role of investment, education, training, sustainability, and regulation in the development of the IOSM industry. The discussions at IOSM 2024 emphasised the importance of innovation and collaboration to maximise the benefits of IOSM, supporting its future growth as a cornerstone of sustainable space infrastructure.\n\nThe success of the inaugural IOSM event in 2024 has set the stage for the UK’s second ISAM Conference in 2025, which will be held at the ICC Belfast. With a significantly expanded programme and increased interest, the 2025 event is expected to reflect the growing importance of IOSM for both UK and international space sectors.\n\n## 3. The Space Industry’s Role in Sustainability\n\n2024 also saw a notable shift in the space industry’s commitment to sustainability, driven by the increasing involvement of the private sector. The Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments Not to Conduct Destructive Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) Testing garnered strong support from space operators, satellite providers, and space-derived service users. As of October 2023, 37 countries, including all EU member states, pledged not to conduct destructive DA-ASAT missile tests, in line with the UN General Assembly’s resolution passed in December 2022.\n\nThis commitment, coupled with ongoing industry efforts to avoid the intentional creation of space debris and safely de-orbit satellites at the end of their operational life, exemplifies the commercial space sector’s growing responsibility in protecting the space environment. The space industry’s active role in space debris mitigation, collision avoidance, and end-of-life satellite management aligns with broader efforts to establish space as a sustainable, shared resource.\n\n## 4. Advancements in Sustainable Space Technologies\n\nThe push for sustainability in space also spurred technological innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of space operations. One of the most notable innovations of 2024 was LignoSat, the world’s first wood-panelled satellite, developed by Japanese researchers. Constructed from sustainable magnolia wood, LignoSat weighs just 900g and is a pioneering step towards using renewable materials in space exploration. Its success could pave the way for sustainable construction materials for future lunar and Martian habitats.\n\nMoreover, the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative continued to advance, with the goal of creating a digital twin of Earth by 2030. The integration of AI, supercomputing, and satellite data will enhance climate modelling, resource management, and disaster prediction, supporting global sustainability and climate action efforts.\n\n## 5. Global Collaboration for Space Sustainability\n\nInternational collaboration remained central to the space sector’s sustainability efforts in 2024. The ITU Space Sustainability Forum, held in Geneva, gathered over 2,000 participants, discussing key issues such as space debris, space traffic management, and the efficient use of orbital resources. The forum highlighted the need for global cooperation, particularly in developing common regulatory frameworks, sharing data on space traffic, and supporting capacity-building for new entrants in the space sector.\n\nThe forum also emphasised the importance of partnerships between space agencies, the private sector, and international organisations to address the pressing challenges of space sustainability. Discussions included the need for transparency, monitoring systems, and regulations to prevent the deliberate creation of long-lived debris, which poses a threat to future space operations.\n\n## 6. The Future of Lunar Exploration and Sustainability\n\nAs lunar exploration picks up pace, the need for sustainable practices extends beyond Earth’s orbit. With multiple nations planning missions to the Moon, discussions in 2024 increasingly focused on ensuring sustainability in lunar operations. This includes developing precise landing technologies and creating shared frameworks for information exchange to avoid interference on the lunar surface.\n\nSustainability on the Moon will require careful management of lunar resources, preventing contamination, and coordinating exploration efforts internationally. These discussions are crucial to ensuring that lunar exploration benefits all of humanity without compromising the space environment.\n\n## Looking Ahead: A Sustainable Future for Space\n\nThe developments in 2024 demonstrate a growing consensus within the space sector about the importance of sustainability. From advancements in in-orbit servicing, space debris management, and technological innovations to international agreements on responsible space practices, the space industry is making significant strides toward ensuring that space remains a sustainable resource.\n\nAs the space sector continues to expand, these efforts will be critical to ensuring the safe, peaceful, and responsible use of space. Through international collaboration, technological innovation, and industry leadership, the space community is poised to tackle the challenges of the coming decades, ensuring that space remains a shared and sustainable domain for future generations.&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/blog/2024-in-review.md&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;043583503e79ca39&quot;],&quot;rendered&quot;:[0,{&quot;html&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The year 2024 marked a significant period of transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability.

Since then, Earth Day has evolved into a global phenomenon, mobilising billions of individuals worldwide to protect our planet. This year, as we mark Earth Day 2024, the focus is on one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time: plastic pollution in our oceans.\n\nMarine litter, particularly plastic waste, poses a grave threat to ecosystems, marine life, and human health. Every year, millions of tonnes of solid waste find their way into our oceans, wreaking havoc on delicate ecosystems and endangering marine species. Plastic production has skyrocketed in recent decades, with approximately ten million tonnes of plastic entering our oceans annually – equivalent to a fresh truckload of plastic dumped every single minute. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for action to address the scourge of plastic pollution.\n\nInnovations in detecting plastic marine litter from space offer a glimmer of hope in our fight against plastic pollution. The European Space Agency’s Discovery Element funded 25 innovative projects dedicated to detecting and tracking seaborne plastic litter using satellite technology. These projects represent a crucial step forward in our ability to monitor and manage marine litter on a global scale. By harnessing the power of remote sensing from space, researchers can better understand the scope of the problem and develop targeted solutions to mitigate plastic pollution.\n\nWhile current satellite sensors can detect large accumulations of floating debris, advancements are needed to improve spatial resolution and sensitivity for detecting plastic litter specifically. The campaign highlighted the potential of airborne and ground-based remote sensing technologies, paving the way for the development of commercial monitoring services. Additionally, there is growing interest in extending monitoring efforts from the sea and coastlines to rivers and polluted lands, embracing a holistic approach to remote sensing.\n\nAs we mark Earth Day 2024, EARTHDAY.ORG‘s theme of “Planet vs. Plastics” resonates deeply with the global community. Our commitment to ending plastics for the sake of human and planetary health is unwavering. We demand a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040 and advocate for urgent action to phase out single-use plastics, push for a strong UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution, and put an end to the fast fashion industry’s reliance on plastic.\n\nThe Planet vs. Plastics initiative unites people from all walks of life in a collective effort to build a plastic-free future. From students to businesses, governments to NGOs, we are all called to action to champion sustainability and combat plastic pollution.

The conference focused on the transformative potential of Earth Observation (EO) data across various sectors. This year’s presentations highlighted how EO data can tackle pressing challenges, including climate change and resource management.\n\n## Insights from Our Presentation\n\nIn a session titled “The Business of EO,” Director of Green Orbit Digital, Ryan Laird, presented “Utilising Earth Observation Data to Drive Sustainable Marketing and Consumer Behaviour.” This talk explored how businesses can harness EO data to craft marketing campaigns that appeal to eco-conscious consumers. As sustainability becomes central to corporate agendas, EO data provides a valuable tool for substantiating sustainability claims, building consumer trust, and driving meaningful behavioural change.\n\n## Key Takeaways from Our Talk\n\n- Transforming Data into Engagement: EO data helps visualise real-time environmental impacts, making the effects of consumption more tangible. For instance, EO data can illustrate deforestation linked to palm oil production, clarifying the environmental consequences of consumer choices. This approach can significantly enhance consumer engagement in sustainability initiatives.\n\n- Localised Campaigns for Maximum Impact: EO data enables businesses to tailor campaigns to address regional environmental concerns. We shared a case study of a global fashion brand that used EO data to monitor water usage in key manufacturing regions. By highlighting local water scarcity, the brand effectively connected with consumers on a regional level while promoting responsible practices.\n\n- Building Trust Through Transparency: Transparency is increasingly demanded by consumers. EO data can substantiate claims about product sourcing, production, and environmental impact. Our talk emphasised how transparency builds trust, helping brands stand out in the crowded eco-friendly market.\n\n- Empowering Consumers with Interactive Tools: EO data allows businesses to create interactive platforms that track the environmental footprint of purchases. We discussed an example where a food company developed an app to monitor the carbon footprint of individual ingredients, encouraging more informed and sustainable consumer choices.\n\n- EO Data as a CSR and Brand Differentiator: Integrating EO data into sustainability efforts supports Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals and enhances brand credibility. Companies using EO data to verify their environmental claims gain a competitive edge and contribute to broader sustainability efforts.\n\n- Collaboration with Policymakers: Our presentation also explored how businesses can work with policymakers to ensure accuracy and transparency in sustainability claims, fostering a more robust market for eco-friendly products.\n\nRelated Talks and Broader ContextNEOC 2024 featured several sessions showcasing innovative uses of EO data.

Behind every breakthrough, from space debris mitigation to Earth observation for climate monitoring, lies the essential task of storytelling. In a domain as complex and rapidly evolving as space, marketing bridges the gap between technical innovation and public understanding, shaping the future of the industry.\n\nThis year, the priorities of the space sector—from the Zero Debris Charter to Destination Earth—illustrated the sector’s ambition to balance innovation with responsibility. However, these efforts will only succeed if communicated effectively to diverse stakeholders: governments, investors, industries, and the public.\n\n## 1. Marketing Translates Complexity into Clarity\n\nSpace sustainability involves intricate issues such as orbital congestion, debris mitigation, and in-orbit servicing. For these efforts to gain traction, they must resonate beyond the technical audience.\n\nMarketing excels at transforming complexity into relatable narratives:\n\n- A dense concept like in-orbit servicing becomes a story of satellites receiving “check-ups” to extend their lifespans.\n\n- The threat of space debris is visualised as a growing junkyard in orbit, threatening the highways of global connectivity.\n\nThese simplified yet impactful narratives enable policymakers, investors, and the public to understand and advocate for solutions.\n\n## 2. Creating Stakeholder Alignment Through Storytelling\n\nThe space sector thrives on collaboration, from international agreements on space debris to partnerships in Earth observation. Marketing plays a crucial role in aligning stakeholders by emphasising shared goals:\n\n- For governments, campaigns highlight how space technologies support policy priorities, such as climate resilience or national security.\n\n- For private investors, storytelling focuses on returns on investment, showcasing how sustainability initiatives can drive economic growth and innovation.\n\n- For the public, communications build trust by demonstrating tangible benefits, such as satellites aiding disaster relief or advancing broadband access.\n\nBy aligning these diverse audiences, marketing ensures momentum for sustainability initiatives.\n\n## 3. Building Advocacy for Space Sustainability\n\nPublic trust and support are critical to the success of space sustainability.

By amplifying voices, sharing stories, and mobilising communities, we can collectively rise to the challenge of climate change, safeguarding our planet and ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit: The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission: the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=\&quot;empowering-climate-communication-with-green-orbit-digital\&quot;&gt;Empowering Climate Communication with Green Orbit Digital&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Green Orbit Digital, we understand the critical importance of effective climate communication in driving meaningful action.

Leveraging scientific insights, bolstered by satellite data, is indispensable for formulating evidence-based policies and strategies aimed at mitigating climate risks and fostering sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the words of Celeste Saulo, Secretary-General of the WMO, “The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our generation. The cost of climate action may seem high, but the cost of inaction is much higher.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Embracing the imperative of sustainability is not merely an option but a moral imperative for safeguarding our planet and its inhabitants for generations to come. As we navigate the complexities of a changing climate, the insights gleaned from space serve as beacons of hope, guiding us towards a future where resilience, adaptation, and sustainability reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information on the European State of the Climate report and the Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, visit Copernicus Climate Change Service and
